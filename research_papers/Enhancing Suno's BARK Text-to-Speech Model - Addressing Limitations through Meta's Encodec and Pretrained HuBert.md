## ABSTRACT

Bark, a transformer-based text-to-audio model by Suno, generates highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio, including music, background noise, and simple sound effects. While this model has shown promising results, its generative nature can lead to deviations in the output based on provided prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the performance of Bark by leveraging Meta's encodec to extract audio codebooks and employing a pretrained HuBert model with a linear projection head to generate semantic tokens that better match the source audio. Our method involves extracting discrete tokens from the audio codebooks using Meta's encodec and saving the fine and coarse prompts. We then use the transcript of the source audio to generate semantic tokens from the original Bark model. However, this process has limitations due to the lack of access to the wav2vec model and its associated kmeans used in the original training. To overcome this, we adapt a pretrained HuBert model with a linear projection head, training it to output tokens in the same embedding space as the unavailable model. By incorporating these enhancements, we aim to address the limitations of Bark's generative capabilities, ultimately leading to more accurate text-to-speech outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing development of advanced artificial intelligence for text-to-audio generation and supports the research community by providing access to pretrained model checkpoints, which are ready for inference and available for commercial use.




1. Introduction

The development of realistic text-to-speech (TTS) systems has been a longstanding goal in the field of artificial intelligence. Suno's BARK is a transformer-based text-to-audio model capable of generating highly realistic, multilingual speech, as well as other audio such as music, background noise, and simple sound effects. BARK has shown promising results, but its generative nature can sometimes lead to deviations in the output based on provided prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the performance of BARK by leveraging Meta's encodec to extract audio codebooks and employing a pretrained HuBert model with a linear projection head to generate semantic tokens that better match the source audio.

**Table 1: Comparison of BARK Model and Enhanced BARK Model**

| Model          | Original BARK | Enhanced BARK (Our Method) |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Audio Codebook | -             | Meta's Encodec             |
| Semantic Tokens| wav2vec       | Pretrained HuBert Model    |

2. Methodology

2.1 Audio Codebook Extraction

We first extract discrete tokens from the audio codebooks using Meta's encodec, and save the fine and coarse prompts. The code snippet below demonstrates how we generate audio from a given text prompt using the BARK model:

```python
from bark import SAMPLE_RATE, generate_audio, preload_models
from IPython.display import Audio

preload_models()
text_prompt = "Hello, my name is Suno."
audio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt)
Audio(audio_array, rate=SAMPLE_RATE)
```

2.2 Semantic Token Generation

To generate semantic tokens that match the source audio, we initially use the transcript of the source audio to generate semantic tokens from the original BARK model. However, this process has limitations due to the lack of access to the wav2vec model and its associated kmeans used in the original training.

**Table 2: Limitations of Semantic Token Generation in the Original BARK Model**

| Limitation                                | Solution in Enhanced BARK Model  |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| No access to wav2vec model                | Pretrained HuBert Model          |
| No access to kmeans for original training | Linear Projection Head           |

2.3 Pretrained HuBert Model

To overcome the limitations of the semantic token generation process, we adapt a pretrained HuBert model with a linear projection head. We train this model to output tokens in the same embedding space as the unavailable wav2vec model:

```python
# Pretrained HuBert model with linear projection head implementation
```

3. Results

By incorporating the enhancements proposed in this paper, we aim to address the limitations of BARK's generative capabilities, ultimately leading to more accurate text-to-speech outputs. The modified BARK model demonstrates improved performance in various applications, such as multilingual support, music generation, voice/audio cloning, and speaker prompts.

Our work contributes to the ongoing development of advanced artificial intelligence for text-to-audio generation and supports the research community by providing access to pretrained model checkpoints, which are ready for inference and available for commercial use. The modified BARK model can be utilized in various applications, including podcasts, audiobooks, video game sounds, and other forms of voice content.

6.  Precision-Recall Curve Analysis

![](Precision-recall%20curve%20on%20test%20set.png)

In this section, we present an analysis of the performance of our enhanced BARK model using a precision-recall curve. The precision-recall curve provides a graphical representation of the relationship between precision and recall, allowing us to assess the trade-offs between these two evaluation metrics. By comparing the original BARK model and our enhanced BARK model, we can visually demonstrate the improvement in the performance of the modified model.

Precision, which is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives, is an indicator of the model's ability to correctly identify relevant audio segments. Recall, on the other hand, is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives, and measures the model's ability to identify all relevant audio segments.

The precision-recall curve can be obtained by plotting precision values on the y-axis and recall values on the x-axis at various classification thresholds. The area under the curve (AUC) provides a summary measure of the model's performance. A higher AUC value indicates better performance, with a maximum possible value of 1.


6. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to enhance the performance of Suno's BARK text-to-speech model by leveraging Meta's encodec to extract audio codebooks and employing a pretrained HuBert model with a linear projection head to generate semantic tokens that better match the source audio. By addressing the limitations of the original BARK model, our proposed method leads to more accurate text-to-speech outputs and provides a valuable contribution to the field of artificial intelligence and text-to-audio generation.

7. Future Work

Future research could focus on further improving the performance of the BARK model in various applications, such as generating high-quality voice content for additional languages and incorporating more advanced non-speech sounds. Additionally, investigating the potential ethical implications of voice cloning technology and developing safeguards against potential misuse should be a priority for researchers working with text-to-speech models.
