It has the potential to transform various industries by enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.

One of the key components of machine learning is the development of models that can accurately represent real-world processes and systems. These models can then be trained on large datasets to identify patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems.

Let's explore the concept of machine learning models in more detail, including their different types, how they work, and some real-world examples of their applications. And look at the factors that influence the choice of model and some of the challenges involved in building and using these models effectively.

# **What are machine learning models?**

A machine learning model is a mathematical representation of a system or process that is designed to learn from data.

They are sets of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn patterns and relationships in data, and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.

An algorithm is a well-defined procedure that takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs. The inputs can be data, variables, or conditions, and the outputs can be results, solutions, or decisions.

**What are machine learning models for?**

Machine learning models are used to automate decision-making processes, improve accuracy, and provide insights into complex data. They are applied across a wide range of industries and can have significant impacts on efficiency, productivity, and profitability.

If we can train machines to do things at the same or better skill level of humans, then we can significantly improve quality, speed, cost benefits, etc.

**Here are a few examples of machine learning models with real life applications:**

# **Machine learning categories & algorithms**

Begin by trying to get an idea of what these different models are called, why they are called that (hint: it's based on the type of model they are) and begin to create an understanding of the different groups.

We will keep the technical definitions very light so you can understand the core concepts first.
