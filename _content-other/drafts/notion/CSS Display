# CSS Display

---

The `display` property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout - it specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. 

The default display value for most elements is: `block` or `inline`.

## CSS block-level elements

A `block`-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

## CSS inline elements

An `inline` element does not start on a new line. It only takes up as much width as necessary.

## Display: none;

`display: none;` is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. 

The `<script>` element uses `display: none;` as default.

## Overriding the default `display: ;` value

Although every element has a default display value - you can override this. 

Use the `display: _;` property to override the default value of `display: none;`.

## Hiding elements on a page

You can hide elements on a page using certain `display` values.

### Hide elements on a page with `display: none;`

Set the `display` property to `none` if you want the element to be hidden - and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there
