# SQL Comparison Operators

---

Comparison operators are probably the most common of any terminology you will encounter across your entire journey as a programmer. 

So common, in fact, that I guarantee you’ve already encountered them - and so has your 11 year old nephew.

That’s because comparison operators are what we use in math class!

But they aren’t strictly limited to math & numbers anymore - let’s take a look.

| Operator | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Equal to | = |
| Not equal to | <> or != |
| Greather than | > |
| Less that | < |
| Greater than or equal to | >= |
| Less than or equal to | <= |
