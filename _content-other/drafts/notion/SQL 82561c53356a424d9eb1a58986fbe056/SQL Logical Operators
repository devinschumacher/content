# SQL Logical Operators

---

- `LIKE` match similar values, rather than exact ones.
    - In some types of SQL, `LIKE` is case-sensitive. To ignore case sensitivity, use `ILIKE`
- `IN` lets you supply a list of values to include, rather than just a single one.
- `BETWEEN` lets you narrow the request to include only the values in the supplied range.
- `IS NULL` selects rows that contain no data in that particular column.
- `AND` selects rows that satisfies both / all of 2+ conditions.
- `OR` selects rows that satisifies either / any of 2+ conditions.
- `NOT` selects rows that donâ€™t match the supplied conditions.
