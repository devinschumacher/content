# CSS Comments

---

Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date - they are meant for humans & everything written inside of them is ignored by browsers.

However, just because a browser wont process the information inside of the comments as it would if it were applying your CSS - the comments still show up in the source code.

So, any human who wants to read your comments can do so!

## Type & Syntax of Comments in CSS

1. Single-line comments
2. Multi-line comments

Unlinke many programming, markup or styling languages, CSS uses the same syntax for both single  comments & multi-line comments.

CSS comments starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`.

You can write whatever you’d like in between those areas - and it will be ignored. 

It can be on the same line:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;  /* Set all h1 tags to red */
}
```

Or can span across multiple lines:

```css
h1 {
	color: blue;
}

/* i am a multi-line comment
whatever goes in between my asterisks
* will be ignored by the browser
it could even be CSS:

h2 {
	color: yellow;
}

^ sorry folks, but that ain't gonna do anything for your h2 when its here in side a comment block
*/

h2 {
	color: yellow;
}

/* ^ that one will though :) */
```
