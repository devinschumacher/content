# Design System

A design system is composed of 5 pillars:

1. [Design Tokens](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-tokens)
2. [Design Kit](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit)
3. [Component Library](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#component-library)
4. [Content Design](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#content-design)
5. [Documentation site](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#documentation-site)

## **Design Tokens**

These are the foundation of the brand. 

The most common design tokens are `colors` in the brand palette, the `fonts` or `scale sizes`.

Design Tokens are shared across Design Kits and Component Library for a cohesive experie nce.

## **Design Kit |** 🧑 Designers

Also known as UI Kit, a Design Kit is a set of patterns or components existing in `design tools`.

Everything follows the design rules and is built using the Design Tokens.

## **Component Library**

👨‍💻 Developers

A Component Library is the code side of the Design Kit. 

It's a list of `reusable components` the *developers use* to create new experiences.

Like the Design Kit, the Component Library uses the Design Tokens for a consistent design signature that is easy to maintain.

## **Content Design**

The Content Design is meant to be used by everyone - writers or non-writers.

Content Design defines voice, tone and glossary, but also rules and recommendations for writing in an inclusive and consistent manner.

It is like [Design Kit](https://backlight.dev/mastery/what-is-a-design-system#design-kit) for the words and have a tremendous impact on the experience of the user.
