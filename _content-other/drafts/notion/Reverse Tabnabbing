# A Comprehensive Guide to Reverse Tabnabbing: Understanding and Safeguarding Against Stealthy Phishing Attacks

## An Introduction to the World of Tabnabbing Attacks

In the vast and complex realm of web security, phishing attacks are a constant threat. 

Among the myriad of techniques employed by cybercriminals, Tabnabbing stands out as a particularly insidious method.

This refined form of phishing involves the manipulation of browser tabs to deceive users. 

A specific variant of this, known as Reverse Tabnabbing, exploits the way users interact with their browser tabs, with the ultimate goal of gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Phishing attacks have been around for as long as the internet has been in existence. They began as simple email scams but have evolved over time to become more sophisticated and harder to detect. 

Tabnabbing is a perfect example of this evolution. 

It's a technique that takes advantage of the way people use the internet, specifically how they use browser tabs to multitask.

## Tabnabbing: A New Age Phishing Technique

At its core, Tabnabbing is a sophisticated phishing attack where an inactive browser tab is exploited to impersonate a trusted website. 

The objective of this deception is to trick unsuspecting users into entering their sensitive data, such as login credentials, into the fake site.

Reverse phishing, a related concept, occurs when the attacker convinces the victim that they are in a safe and secure environment, all while exploiting underlying security vulnerabilities.

For example, consider a user who has multiple tabs open, one of which is their email account.

- The user then opens a new tab to visit a different site.
- While the user is engaged with the new site, the email tab changes to a login page that looks identical to the email service's login page.
- When the user clicks back to the email tab, they assume they've been logged out and enter their credentials, unknowingly giving them to the attacker.

## A Closer Look: The Mechanics of Tabnabbing Attacks

Tabnabbing operates by altering the content and title of an open tab to mimic a legitimate site. The attacker leverages JavaScript to rewrite the contents of the inactive tab.

The HTML attribute `target="_blank"` in conjunction with the JavaScript property `window.opener` plays a pivotal role in executing this attack by granting the attacker control over the parent tab.

### Example

A non malicious website inadvertently links to a malicious website, or a non-malicious website that maybe gets hacked!

Here is the link HTML: 

```python
<a href="<http://destination-website.com>" target="_blank">Click me!</a>
```

Since `rel="noopener"` was not used, the destination website has access to the previous website via JavaScript.

Now, on the ‘destination-website.com’ some JavaScript is executed with the `window.opener` function to change the location of the original tab to a fake login page - tricking the user into entering their credentials:

```python
window.opener.location = "http://fake-login.com";
```

Once the site has tricked the user into entering their sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details, the attacker can use this information for various nefarious purposes.

## Consequences of tabnabbing

1. **Identity Theft**: The attacker can use the stolen credentials to impersonate the user, gaining access to their accounts, personal information, and services. This could include email accounts, social media profiles, online banking, or any other services where the stolen credentials are used.
2. **Financial Fraud**: If the stolen information includes credit card details or banking credentials, the attacker could conduct fraudulent transactions, make unauthorized purchases, or even drain the victim's bank accounts.
3. **Spam and Phishing Attacks**: The attacker could use the victim's email account to send out spam or further phishing attacks, potentially tricking the victim's contacts into also providing their sensitive information.
4. **Ransom Attacks**: In some cases, the attacker might change the victim's account passwords, effectively locking them out of their own accounts. The attacker could then demand a ransom to restore access.
5. **Data Breach**: If the compromised account contains sensitive data (such as customer information in a business account), the attacker could steal this data and either use it for further attacks, sell it on the dark web, or publicly disclose it in a damaging data breach.

In all these scenarios, the consequences for the victim can be severe, including financial loss, damage to reputation, loss of personal or business data, and the significant stress and time involved in recovering from identity theft or fraud. 

This highlights the importance of being aware of such attacks and taking appropriate measures to secure your online activities.

## **Deciphering Reverse Tabnabbing**

Reverse Tabnabbing is a variant of Tabnabbing where the attacker exploits the **`rel`** attribute when it is not set or set improperly. 

This oversight allows the new page to gain control over the initial page, potentially altering its contents to something malicious.

### Example:

```python
<a href="http://destinatino-site.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click me!</a>
```

In this case, the **`rel="noopener"`** attribute prevents the new page from accessing the **`window.opener`** property, thus preventing the new page from controlling the original page.

## **A Loophole in the Same Origin Policy**

The Same Origin Policy is acrucial security measure employed by web browsers to prevent scripts from one site accessing data used by scripts from another site. 

However, Tabnabbing exploits a loophole in this policy.

The policy does not restrict the new page from accessing the **`window.opener`** property, thereby giving it control over the tab that opened it.

The Same Origin Policy is a fundamental concept in web security. It restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. 

An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. This policy is critical for isolating potentially malicious scripts.

However, the **`window.opener`** property provides a backdoor for bypassing the Same Origin Policy. When a window is opened using **`window.open()`**, the **`window.opener`** property will return a reference to the window that opened it. 

This reference can then be used to manipulate the parent window, regardless of whether it's from the same origin.

## **Hands-on Experimentation: Try Reverse Tabnabbing Yourself!**

For educational purposes, setting up a controlled environment for experimentation can be invaluable. 

You can use HTML and JavaScript to create simple web pages and attempt to change the content of the original tab using **`window.opener`**.

This hands-on experience can provide a deeper understanding of how these attacks work and how to prevent them.

**Here's a simple exercise you can try:**

1. Create a new HTML file with the following content:

```python
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">Go to example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```

1. Open this file in your browser and click the link to open a new tab.
2. In the new tab, open the JavaScript console and enter the following command:

```python
window.opener.location = "http://fake-login.com";
```

1. Switch back to the original tab and observe the change.

## **Different Methods of Reverse Tabnabbing**

- **Reverse Tabnabbing via the good site opening a window**: This method occurs when a legitimate site opens a new tab, and that new tab is subsequently exploited by an attacker.
- **Reverse Tabnabbing through links**: In this method, attackers inject malicious links into web pages, which when clicked, exploit this vulnerability.
- **Reverse Tabnabbing using frames**: By using frames, attackers can run malicious scripts, thereby gaining control over the parent tab.

Each of these methods has its own unique characteristics and requires different countermeasures. However, the common thread is that they all involve manipulating the **`window.opener`** property to gain control over another tab.

## **Strategies to Prevent Tabnabbing Attacks**

Protection against Tabnabbing involves a combination of security measures, such as implementing a cross-origin opener policy, setting the correct attributes on links, and sandboxing iframes.

- **Implementing a Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)**: COOP is a security feature that isolates windows to prevent them from interacting with each other. This can prevent an attacker from using **`window.opener`** to control another window.
- **Setting the correct attributes on links**: When creating links that open in a new tab, always include the **`rel="noopener"`** attribute. This prevents the new page from accessing the **`window.opener`** property.
- **Sandboxing iframes**: The **`sandbox`** attribute can restrict what an iframe can do, including running scripts and accessing the **`window.opener`** property.

## **The Role of Cross-Origin Opener Policy in Prevention**

Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) isolates windows to add an additional layer of protection. Implementing it involves setting headers in the web page response to limitwhich windows can interact with it.

This effectively prevents other pages from manipulating the original page, thereby mitigating the risk of Tabnabbing attacks.

Here's an example of how to set the COOP header in an HTTP response:

```python
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

In this example, the **`same-origin`** value means that the document can only interact with other documents from the same origin. Any other documents will be isolated in a separate browsing context.

## **Best Practices: Setting rel="noopener" Attribute**

One of the most effective ways to prevent Reverse Tabnabbing is by using the **`rel="noopener"`** attribute on all links that open in a new tab.

This attribute prevents the new page from controlling the originating page by nullifying the **`window.opener`** property. This is a simple yet essential security practice that can significantly enhance the security of your web pages.

Here's an example of how to use the **`rel="noopener"`** attribute:

```python
<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go to example.com</a>
```

In this example, the **`rel="noopener"`** attribute prevents the new tab from accessing the **`window.opener`** property, thus preventing it from controlling the original tab.

## **The Protective Power of the Sandbox Attribute for Frames**

Sandboxing iframes can provide a robust defense against Reverse Tabnabbing. The sandbox attribute restricts the actions that can be performed by content within the iframe, including running scripts or changing the parent's content.

This can effectively prevent an attacker from gaining control over the parent tab.

Here's an example of how to use the **`sandbox`** attribute:

```python
<iframe src="http://example.com" sandbox></iframe>
```

In this example, the **`sandbox`** attribute prevents the iframe from running scripts, changing the parent's content, or performing other potentially harmful actions.

## **Enhancing Security with Fetch Metadata and Isolation Policy**

Fetch metadata provides web developers with the ability to make informed decisions about what should be loaded on their websites.

By isolating documents and embedding resources, Fetch metadata can significantly aid in preventing Tabnabbing attacks. It allows developers to understand the context of a request and decide whether to allow or block it based on security considerations.

Here's an example of how to use fetch metadata:

```python
let destination = request.headers.get('sec-fetch-dest');
let mode = request.headers.get('sec-fetch-mode');

if (mode === 'navigate' && destination === 'document') {
  // This is a top-level navigation request. Apply stricter controls.
} else {
  // This is a subresource request. Apply standard controls.
}
```

In this example, the **`sec-fetch-dest`** and **`sec-fetch-mode`** headers provide information about the request, which can be used to apply different security controls.

## **Browser Countermeasures Against Tabnabbing**

Modern browsers are continually implementing features to protect against Tabnabbing. These countermeasures include defaulting to noopener behavior and blocking suspicious activity.

Keeping your browsers updated is a simple yet effective security measure that can help protect against these and other types of attacks.

For example, recent versions of Chrome and Firefox now default to **`rel="noopener"`** behavior for all links that open in a new tab. This means that even if you forget to include the **`rel="noopener"`** attribute, the browser will still prevent the new tab from accessing the **`window.opener`** property.

## **Real-world Examples of Reverse Tabnabbing**

Reverse Tabnabbing has been exploited in real-world attacks. Studying these examples can offer valuable insights into the tactics used by attackers and reinforce the importance of proactive security measures.

For instance, in 2018, a security researcher discovered that about 25% of the Alexa Top 500 websites were vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing, highlighting the widespread nature of this issue.

In another case, a popular social media platform was found to be vulnerable to Reverse Tabnabbing. The platform allowed users to post links that opened in a new tab, but did not include the **`rel="noopener"`** attribute. This allowed an attacker to post a malicious link that, when clicked, could take control of the social media tab and change its content to a fake login page.
