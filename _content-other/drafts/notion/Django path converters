# Django path converters

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('index/<this:that>/', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

Thise part: `<this:that>` are path converters:

### this

`this` = is the type of the variable that you are capturing. 

Django will use this to validate and convert the captured string into the specified type. 

Some of the built-in types are **`str`**, **`int`**, **`slug`**, and **`uuid`**. **`str`**, which is used in the example, will match any non-empty string, excluding the path separator, '/'.

Django allows you to define custom path converters.

- [Django custom path converters](Django%20custom%20path%20converters%20b15358de3efa42d8b4ec1a93f34c8532.md)

### that

`that` = is the variable name that you will use in your view to access the captured value. 

This value will be passed as an argument to the view function.

In the example, **`template_version`** is used as the variable name.
