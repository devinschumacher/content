# Shadow DOM

Shadow DOM provides encapsulation. 

It allows a component to have its very own “shadow” DOM tree, that can’t be accidentally accessed from the main document, may have local style rules, and more.

The browser uses DOM/CSS internally to draw/style/present HTML elements, which is hidden by default, but can be seen via: Developer Tools > “Show user agent shadow DOM”.

These ‘built-in shadow DOM elements’ cannot be targeted/accessed by regular JavaScript calls or selectors.

For example, a simple `<input type="range">` looks like this:

![Untitled](Shadow%20DOM%2020a2a36852e74545940da5c2fa23cce9/Untitled.png)

What you see under `#shadow-root` is called “shadow DOM”.

In the screenshot above, you can see a useful attribute `pseudo`.
