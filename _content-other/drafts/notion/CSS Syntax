# CSS Syntax

CSS syntax is quite simple, it consists of:

- a ‘selector’
- a ‘declaration’

**CSS Syntax Example 1:**

```css
h1 {color:brown; font-size: 35px;}
```

## CSS selectors

CSS selectors point to a corresponding HTML element that it is giving style direction to.

*In the above example the CSS selector is the `h1`HTML element.*

## CSS declarations

A CSS declaration is all of the styling instructions being given to that specific HTML element.

The declaration is made up of: 

1. ‘properties’ and ‘values’
    1. You can think of these like “key:value” pairs if you’re familiar with those.
2. a semi-colon ( `;` ) at the end of each “property: value” pair
3. curly braces ( `{ }` ) surrounding the entire declaration

*In the above example the CSS declaration is made up of 2 “property:value” pairs:*

- `color: brown;`
- `font-size: 35px;`

**CSS Syntax Example 2:**

For readability, CSS is normally not written in one continuous line, as we saw in example 1. 

A more correct way to write that CSS statement would be like this:

```css
h1 {
  color: brown;
  font-size: 35px;
}
```
