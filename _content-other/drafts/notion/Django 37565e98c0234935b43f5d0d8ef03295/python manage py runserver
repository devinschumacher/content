# python manage.py runserver

# Explanation of "python [manage.py](http://manage.py/) runserver" command

The `python [manage.py](http://manage.py/) runserver` command is used in Django web framework to start the development server. 

This command should be executed in the project's root directory, where [manage.py](http://manage.py/) is located.

When executed, the command starts the server, which listens to requests from the client and responds with the appropriate output. 

By default, the **`[runserver](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-runserver)`** command starts the development server on the internal IP at port 8000.

If you want to change the server’s port, pass it as a command-line argument. For instance, this command starts the server on port 8080: 

`python manage.py runserver 8080`

If you want to change the server’s IP, pass it along with the port, for example:

`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

## **Automatic reloading of `[runserver](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-runserver)`**

The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed. 

You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect. 

However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.
