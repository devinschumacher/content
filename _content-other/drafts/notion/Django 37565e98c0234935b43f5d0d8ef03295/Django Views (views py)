# Django Views (views.py)

A view is a function / method that takes http requests as parameters, imports the relevant models (from `models.py`), and finds out what data to send to the html page template - then ‘returns’ the final result.

Views are usually put in a file called `views.py` located on your app's folder.

A web page that uses Django is full of views with different tasks and missions.

Default `views.py`:

```jsx
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
```

Add in support for http requests:

```jsx
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world!")
```

## How to create views in django

**There are 2 ways to create views:**

1. function based views
2. class based views

### Function based views

### Class based views

### Connecting views to `urls.py`

When you create a view, you need to call that view in your `[urls.py](http://urls.py)` file.
