# DNS Leaks

# What is a DNS Leak?

A DNS Leak is a security flaw that happens when the Domain Name System (DNS) settings of your operating system (OS) are no longer effective in protecting your privacy.

If you are not using a VPN, DNS leaks are relatively common.

Most operating systems tend to use the DNS settings of the internet service provider (ISP), and these settings can be easily accessed and modified by ISPs or cybercriminals.

When a DNS leak occurs, personal information such as your IP address, DNS server, and search queries can be intercepted and accessed by an unauthorized third party.

\##How do hackers intercept your search queries?

This could potentially lead to identity theft, data breaches, and even infiltration of your network by malicious actors. Furthermore, ISPs can also track your online activity and censor content.

When a DNS Leak occurs, any requests you make to look-up Web addresses or other domain names will not go through the VPN connection, but instead, be directly routed to your ISPâ€™s DNS server, thus leaving your true IP address exposed and visible to anyone who can access the query.

Dangers

A DNS Leak can leak your IP address and therefore reveal your geographic location to the websites you visit or to anyone who can access the DNS query logs. This could allow hackers to access your personal information or to attack your computer, as well as leave you vulnerable to malicious ads, spyware, and malware. Additionally, a DNS Leak could cause you to lose your anonymity, and could potentially put your online activities under government surveillance.  It can also render your VPN ineffective as your personal information is still exposed and vulnerable to attack.

## What happens when there is a DNS leak?

If a DNS leak is detected, it means that your DNS (Domain Name System) queries are sent outside the encrypted VPN tunnel. Your device continues to use your ISP's DNS server.

The Internet resources you visit and your geographic location can be tracked by third parties.

- Internet traffic data is available for collection and resale
- Requests to websites can be tracked
- It is possible to intercept DNS requests and spoof the site response by intruders

When addressing the domain name system, traffic is not encrypted, which means that if a DNS leak occurs, it is possible to determine where the user is coming from and to which site. A DNS leak discloses your real geographic location.

- Third parties (e.g. your ISP, your employer) may have access to the resources you visit.
- Attackers can use this information to launch phishing attacks or inject malicious code.
