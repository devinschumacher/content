# How Websites Detect Multiple Accounts: The Role of IP Addresses

Have you ever wondered how websites detect multiple accounts? Are you managing multiple accounts in affiliate, e-commerce, dropshipping, crypto, or ticketing businesses and want to know how websites identify you?

## Understanding IP Addresses

IP addresses are uniquely identifiable strings of digits given to you by your internet service provider. They connect you with other websites and enable communication between them. If you're managing multiple accounts and don't change your IP address, websites can easily detect that and block you for running multiple accounts.

There are two popular ways to change your IP address: using a VPN or using proxies.

Websites look for two categories of IP addresses: residential IPs and datacenter IPs. Datacenter IPs belong to data centers and are generally used to host servers, different databases, and websites.

Residential IPs belong to internet service providers and are typically used by homes or mobile devices. Websites trust residential IPs more because it's not very common for normal website visitors to connect to a website from datacenter IPs.

Mobile IPs are another type of IP address that belong to residential IPs. They are very dynamic IP addresses, and multiple users can have the same mobile IP address at the same time, making them difficult for websites to block.

There are many other methods that websites can deploy in order to detect proxies, including port scanning and scanning for headers.

## Browser Fingerprints

Websites can also take a look at your browser fingerprints and analyze whether they are consistent with the information of your IP address. There are four main browser fingerprints that can reveal your location: time zone, webRTC IP address, geolocation API, and language. Websites can easily detect anomalies and restrict your accounts if you just mask your IP address using a proxy and don't care about these parameters.

### An Example of IP Addresses

We show an example of three types of IP addresses. One belongs to a datacenter, one is a residential IP address, and the other is a mobile IP address. Websites can see whether your IP address is a datacenter, residential, or mobile.

## Choosing the Right Proxy

Residential or mobile IPs are currently the best, as they are difficult to block. Datacenter proxies may also work, but you have to ensure that you have a datacenter proxy provider that provides exclusive IP addresses for you.

Mobile proxies are becoming the winners because many different users that are using mobile internet may have the same IP address. Residential and mobile IPs can be expensive, but there is a cheap method of creating your own mobile proxy using an android device.

Knowing how websites use IP addresses to detect you and block you is important if you're managing multiple accounts. Education is the key, and if you know how these systems work, you can properly combat them and work with them.
