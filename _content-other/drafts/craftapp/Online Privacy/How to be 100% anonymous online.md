# How to be 100% anonymous online

First, check your current anonymity level at [Whoer.net](check your current anonymity level again at: Whoer.net)

Enable "do not track" on your web browser.

1. ## Connect to a VPN

A VPN connection will hide your IP address, your [DNS](https://whoer.net/dns-leak-test) and your actual location.

Download a free trail VPN @ [Whoer](devin.to/whoer).

Install the program & enable the VPN.

Next, check your anonymity level again at: [Whoer.net](devin.to/whoer) and compare it to the initial test.

## 2. Set your system timezone settings to match your VPN

Check the timezone of your VPN, and match your computers system settings to it.

3. ## Set the language settings of your system to match your VPN

A "language setting" notification means that the language of your operating system and browser is different from that of the server’s location.To understand which language should be set, determine to which VPN server you intend to connect.

To remove this notification, go to your browser’s settings, choose Advanced Settings and add the language of your server’s location.
