### Kill Switch

A kill switch is a feature that helps to preserve your privacy while connected to a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

This helps to keep your data from being leaked and exposed to potential third-party observers.

The kill switch feature offered by PureVPN works by automatically detecting when your connection to the server is lost, and instantly disconnecting your device from the internet in order to prevent any data from being leaked. This provides a secure and reliable form of digital security.

In addition to protecting your digital privacy, kill switch technology also helps to improve the overall performance of your VPN connection. This is because, without the kill switch feature, any packets of data that are sent or received during a connection break are sent without encryption, and take longer to reach their intended destination. By automatically disconnecting your device during connection breaks, PureVPN ensures that all of your data remains securely encrypted, so your download and upload speeds remain fast and consistent.
