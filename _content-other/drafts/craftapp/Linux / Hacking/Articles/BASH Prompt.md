The bash prompt is easy to understand and, by default, includes information such as the user, hostname, and current working directory. It is a string of characters displayed on the terminal screen that indicates that the system is ready for our input.

It typically includes information such as the current user, the computerâ€™s hostname, and the current working directory. The prompt is usually displayed on a new line, and the cursor is positioned after the prompt, ready for the user to start typing a command.

It can be customized to provide useful information to the user.

**The format can look something like this:**

```bash
<username>@<hostname><current working directory>$
```
