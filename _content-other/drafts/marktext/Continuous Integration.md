# Continuous Integration (CI)

You use CI to always have your software in a 'releasable state'.

CI is all about *verifying* your code.

You use "gates" to *verify*, and then *transformations* to build & run.

On every commit, your code must pass through the *gates*, verifying that it works. If it passes through, then it can be transformed into a product.

Tests confirm that your code does what you meant for it to do.

Tests must be run on every single change.
