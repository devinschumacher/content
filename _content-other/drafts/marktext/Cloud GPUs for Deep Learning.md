# Best Cloud GPUs for Deep Learning

Deep learning is a [Machine Learning](https://serp.ai/machine-learning/) technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example - a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. 

It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers.

In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. 

The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. 

The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.

### How does deep learning attain such impressive results?

In a word, accuracy. Deep learning achieves recognition accuracy at higher levels than ever before. This helps consumer electronics meet user expectations, and it is crucial for safety-critical applications like driverless cars. Recent advances in deep learning have improved to the point where deep learning outperforms humans in some tasks like classifying objects in images.

While deep learning was first theorized in the 1980s, there are two main reasons it has only recently become useful:

1. Deep learning requires large amounts of **labeled data**. For example, driverless car development requires millions of images and thousands of hours of video.
2. Deep learning requires substantial **computing power**. High-performance GPUs have a parallel architecture that is efficient for deep learning. When combined with clusters or cloud computing, this enables development teams to reduce training time for a deep learning network from weeks to hours or less.

## Examples of Deep Learning at Work

Deep learning applications are used in industries from automated driving to medical devices.

### Automated Driving

Automotive researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect objects such as stop signs and traffic lights. In addition, deep learning is used to detect pedestrians, which helps decrease accidents.

### Aerospace and Defense

Deep learning is used to identify objects from satellites that locate areas of interest, and identify safe or unsafe zones for troops.

### Medical Research

Cancer researchers are using deep learning to automatically detect cancer cells. Teams at UCLA built an advanced microscope that yields a high-dimensional data set used to train a deep learning application to accurately identify cancer cells.

### Industrial Automation

Deep learning is helping to improve worker safety around heavy machinery by automatically detecting when people or objects are within an unsafe distance of machines.

### Electronics

Deep learning is being used in automated hearing and speech translation. For example, home assistance devices that respond to your voice and know your preferences are powered by deep learning applications.

## How Deep Learning Works

Most deep learning methods use **[neural network](https://serp.ai/neural-networks/)[Neural Networks - SERP AI](https://serp.ai/neural-networks/)** architectures, which is why deep learning models are often referred to as **deep neural networks**.

Deep learning models are trained by using large sets of labeled data and neural network architectures that learn features directly from the data without the need for manual feature extraction.

One of the most popular types of deep neural networks is known as [convolutional neural networks](https://serp.ai/convolutional-neural-network/). A CNN convolves learned features with input data, and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images.

CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature extraction, so you do not need to identify features used to classify images. The CNN works by extracting features directly from images. 

The relevant features are not pretrained; they are learned while the network trains on a collection of images. This automated feature extraction makes deep learning models highly accurate for [computer vision](https://serp.ai/computer-vision/) tasks such as object classification.
