# Version Control

Version control is software for tracking changes to plain text. 

Each change is identified by a *version*, also called a *commit* or *revision*.

Version control provides:

1. A central location to store everything (repository).

2. A history of all changes, with each change resulting in a new uniquely identifiable version.

3. A single source of truth.

All plain text data should go into version control.
