# Linting

Linting allows you to identify & flag known issues & coding standard violations. 

It helps reduce bugs in code & makes it easier to maintain.

Linting is a form of static analysis - analyzing code without executing it.

## Linters

Linters are tools that analyze & interact with code. They as usually language specific.

Linters will typically categorize the problems they find into 3 buckets:

1. Bugs

2. Errors

3. Style



### Bugs

Code misuses that lead to undesirable behavior. 

Examples:

- Unitialized variables

- Formatting variable mismatches



### Errors

Code misues that do not affect behavior.

Examples:

- Unused variables

- Aliasing variables



### Style

Inconsistent code style decisions / code smells.

Examples:

- Long function signatures

- INconsistent ordering in imports



## Benefits

- Can catch bugs

- Makes code easier to maintain & read
