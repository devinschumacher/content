# Automation

If you rely on humans to do something that always, without fail, needs to be done they will make mistakes. That's what humans do. 

Automation lets humans be humans - and gives these tasks to machines. 

When you need to guarantee that something is done the exact same way, every time, correctly - the only solution is automation.
