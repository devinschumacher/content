# Test Failures

Everytime a test fails, it means one of two (or both) things has happened:

1. The test was written incorrectly

2. The system as a bug



Most of the time is here too change the test it is to figure out why the behavior is happening, but doing this is a quick way of introducing noise and creating a potential [noisy success](Noisy Success.md).



Whenever a test fails you must treated as the same way you would a code bug and fully investigate it.
