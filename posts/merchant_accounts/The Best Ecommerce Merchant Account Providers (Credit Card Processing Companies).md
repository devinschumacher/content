## **Getting to the Heart of eCommerce Payment Processing:**

In essence, eCommerce payment processing acts as a conduit for merchants or company owners to accept payments when customers do transactions on their websites. The advancement of technology has provided eCommerce companies with a myriad of choices for accepting consumer payments.

A trademark of top-tier processors is the offering of personalized solutions tailored to the specific demands of their merchant customers. These processors go above and above, customizing their services to provide a personalized and efficient payment processing experience.

## **Merchant Account Decoding:**

The path of electronic transactions begins with the opening of a merchant account—a unique financial tool supplied by an acquiring bank. This customized account serves as a safe repository, similar to a "holding tank," where customer funds are temporarily housed.

When a customer's payment is approved, the monies smoothly transfer from the customer's account to the merchant account. Following the rigorous subtraction of transaction fees and other costs, the refined monies are sent to a business bank account, ready for the merchant's immediate access.

This complex procedure not only ensures safe cash flow but also lays the groundwork for a simplified and effective eCommerce transactional trip.

## **Understanding the Function of a Merchant Services Provider:**

A merchant services provider is, at its heart, a dynamic business that smoothly delivers a combination of critical services, including merchant accounts and payment processing solutions. Within this diversified environment, some businesses specialize only in merchant accounts or payment processing, while others form strategic alliances between merchant account providers and payment processors.

The attractiveness of working with merchant services providers is in the complete approach they give for many discerning business owners. Choosing a single provider that handles both merchant accounts and payment processing becomes a popular option, as it streamlines operational efficiency and consolidates the diversity of services necessary for successful business transactions.

## **Investigating Your Online Payment Processing Options:**

In the field of online payment processing, you have a plethora of possibilities for your eCommerce company. You may tailor your approach to your company model by using a single technique or a mix-and-match strategy, which is especially useful if your firm covers both internet and mobile app platforms.

### **Gateways for payments:**

Consider payment gateways to be the digital equivalents of traditional POS systems or credit card terminals. When credit card information is entered into a terminal or manually entered into a shopping cart or hosted payment form, it is encrypted before being communicated to the payment processor. It then navigates the network, resulting in either payment acceptance or denial.

### **Terminals Virtual:**

Virtual terminals allow for the acceptance of a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, ACH, and electronic checks. Merchants connect into their online accounts using a computer, tablet, or other internet-enabled device and enter payment information into a form for processing.

### **Integrating a Shopping Cart:**

Shopping cart integration is a popular choice among eCommerce retailers due to its seamless functioning. Using your payment processor's API, you can link your shopping cart with their services, allowing you to begin accepting payments from your consumers. The speedy setup of shopping cart connection guarantees that merchants are up and running as soon as possible.

### **Processing Mobile Payments:**

Enter the world of mobile payment processing, an option for eCommerce retailers. This approach entails capturing consumer payment information using a mobile credit card reader. Companies, on the other hand, frequently give the opportunity to accept payments through an app by integrating with the app's shopping cart. This adaptable method offers a new level of simplicity to the payment processing spectrum.

## **Choosing a Merchant Services Provider Over Payment Aggregators: A Strategic Decision**

In the world of eCommerce, many entrepreneurs use payment aggregators like PayPal, Stripe, and Square. These companies provide payment processing services, but their strategy is very different from that of merchant service providers.

So, just what is a payment aggregator? Payment aggregators, unlike merchant service providers, use a single master merchant account for all of their company clients. Customer payments are sent to this central account, where fees are deducted before the cash are distributed to the appropriate merchants.

However, this unique merchant account configuration exposes payment aggregators to increased risks. Any flaws, such as an unusually high number of chargebacks from merchants, represent a risk to the entire processing system. Instances of fraud can result in the freezing of cash or the closure of accounts, leaving merchants without access to their money for lengthy periods of time until the situation is handled.

Choosing to work with a merchant services provider provides a distinct perspective, especially when faced with issues like as fraud and chargebacks. A merchant services provider provides businesses with their own specialized merchant account, and in certain circumstances, numerous accounts if necessary. This proactive configuration protects merchants against the possibility of losing access to all of their cash in the event of a problem.

In effect, collaborating with a merchant services provider reduces risk as compared to the possible weaknesses connected with payment aggregators' master merchant account system.

## **Before deciding on an eCommerce Payment Processor, consider the following.**

Now that you've learned the fundamentals of ecommerce payment processing, it's time to pick one.

But don't be too hasty. As seen by the preceding list, you have several possibilities. It's useful to know what you should think about before making a decision.

### **What Payment Options Would You Like to Provide to Your Customers?**

The more payment options you provide your consumers, the more likely they are to complete the checkout process.

That is precisely what you desire.

The fact is that there are several methods to pay for the items we purchase. Credit and debit cards are only the tip of the iceberg.

Here are some other choices you might wish to consider:

* Credit cards such as JCB and Diners Club are alternatives.
    
* Prepaid credit cards
    
* Gift certificates
    
* ACH
    
* Checks issued electronically
    
* PayPal
    
* Pay with Apple
    
* Wallet by Google
    
* Pay with Samsung
    
* Google Pay
    
* Bitcoin and other digital currencies
    

Some processors may even be able to assist your consumers in setting up "buy now, pay later" payments.

To summarize, the more payment choices you can provide your consumers, the better.

### **Contracts: What You Should Know**

When you decide on a credit card processor, you'll go over the terms of your contract. You should gather as much information as possible and ask questions such as:

* What is the duration of the contract?
    
* Is mobile payment processing equipment included, or do I need to sign a separate contract?
    
* What if I want to terminate my contract early? Will I have to pay an early termination fee?
    
* How will the fees be structured? Will they ever change, and if so, how will they change?
    
* When a consumer seeks a refund or challenges a charge, what happens?
    
* Are there any volume restrictions or minimums that I should be aware of?
    

You should avoid signing a long-term contract with a high early termination cost.

If you decide that this ecommerce payment processing firm is not for you, that sort of contract might cost you a lot of money in the long run.

Ask as many questions as you can come up with. The more questions you ask, the better educated you'll be, which will help you make your final decision.

### **What features are essential?**

The more you discover about some of the great capabilities available to you as you go deeper into the realm of online credit card payments.

You'll want to spend some time considering the features you'll want, but here are some suggestions:

* Reporting via mobile and online
    
* QuickBooks synchronization
    
* "Quick Click" purchasing and payment convenience
    
* Customers who challenge charges might be barred from using the service.
    
* Gift card schemes
    
* Programs for distributing loyalty cards
    
* Acceptance of foreign currencies
    
* The capacity to bill
    
* The ability to automatically take subscription or recurring payments
    

It's also worth noting that as your company grows, you may want to be able to add new features later. Select a processor capable of handling that request.

## **How to Select the Best Credit Card Processor for Your eCommerce Business**

Now that you have a better concept of what you're looking for in an ecommerce credit card processing firm, it's time to pick one.

We've taken the liberty of give you some recommendations on our favorites, but we also have some pro ideas for you.

Because no two ecommerce payment processors are alike, there are a few factors to bear in mind while you shop around.

### **Pricing and Fees**

There will always be fees associated with processing payments through a processor. It's critical to understand industry standards, as well as what specific phrases signify.

### **Interchange**

The interchange rate is the amount that the credit card firm earns each time a consumer pays with a credit card. Each network sets its own tariffs, which vary twice a year (between April and October).

### **Merchant Account Provider Fees**

When you begin receiving payments, your merchant account provider may charge you a fee. You may also find monthly maintenance costs, yearly fees, or chargeback fees (for charges that consumers challenge).

### **Card-Present and Card-Not-Present Transactions**

If your consumer has their card, it is a card-present transaction with a decreased chance of fraud. If they don't have their card, the opposite is true.

These two forms of purchases have distinct transaction rates.

### **Exchange-Plus Pricing**

If your merchant account provider uses an interchange-plus pricing model, you will pay the cost of interchange plus an additional amount that the merchant account provider needs for that specific transaction.

For example, if a customer pays with a Visa card and has the card in their hand, you may be charged 2.7% (interchange) + $0.20. This is the most transparent price choice.

### **Flat-Rate Pricing**

Flat-rate pricing charges the same fee to all customers. They might be a percentage or a percentage plus an additional amount.

This option is frequently picked by newer ecommerce firms that don't process as much volume, thus when these merchants expand, they may seek to negotiate better prices.

### **Pricing Structure with Different Rates**

With tiered rate pricing, each transaction is classified as qualified, mid-qualified, or unqualified.

This technique is less transparent since the merchant may not know which category a transaction belongs into, and few consumers qualify.

### **Access to Your Funds**

After transaction costs are deducted, your funds are transferred into your business bank account. You may find them here.

The issue is, how long does it take for it to happen?

Some processors guarantee daily deposits with a 24-hour turnaround. Others, especially if your firm is considered high-risk, may take up to a week to deposit your funds.

Find out this information before signing any contracts so you know what to expect.

### **Fraud Prevention**

What kind of fraud protection does the credit card processing firm provide? Is there a chargeback prevention program?

Fraud is a major issue in the payment processing sector, and the last thing you want is for anything to go wrong and you lose the capacity to process payments.

Any organization you want to partner with should have a strong fraud prevention strategy in place. You may have to pay a monthly or yearly charge for PCI compliance, but you can do so knowing that your risk of fraud has been greatly reduced.

### **Customer Service and Technical Support**

You should ensure that the processor you pick provides appropriate customer care and technical assistance.

There will be difficulties. You may encounter difficulties processing a customer's payment, or an app may cease to function. You'll want to know that the firm you're working with will respond fast so you don't lose sales.
