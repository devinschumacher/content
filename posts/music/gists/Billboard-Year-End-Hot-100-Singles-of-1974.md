"Business I Will Take Care Of" is a prominent anthem in rock music, written by Randy Bachman of The Guess Who. This upbeat tune brilliantly portrays the workday routine we all face on a daily basis. Initially titled "White Collar Worker," it gained further momentum when Bachman incorporated local radio jockey's catchphrase, "takin' care of business," into its unforgettable chorus line.

The tune's success is largely due to the lyrics combined with the infectious rhythm, ultimately solidifying its indelible mark in the annals of rock history.
