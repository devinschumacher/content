"0 to 100 / The Catch Up" is a chart-topper by Drake, featuring two distinctive parts. The first, titled "0 to 100, " is an energetic rap track with a typical braggadocio vibe, reminiscent of Drake's smash hit "Started from The Bottom. " The second part, "The Catch Up, " showcases a more introspective and reflective side of Drake, with an unreleased James Blake sample adding depth. The song was nominated for multiple awards in 2015 but didn't win.

Rumors of a beat dispute with Diddy added intrigue to the song's development.
