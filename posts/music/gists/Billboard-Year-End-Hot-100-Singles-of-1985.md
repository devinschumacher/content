"Born in the U. S. A. " is a classic American rock anthem, written and performed by Bruce Springsteen. Released in June 1984, this timeless song gained fame for its blistering hard-rock version and powerful message about the country's veterans. Although it might seem to be an overtly patriotic song at first glance, it speaks to the underlying issues faced by the working class, particularly young men, who have returned home after a grueling war.

Springsteen's poignant and introspective lyrics expose America’s deep internal divisions and the spiritual crisis these men face, despite their apparent triumph. Despite the misconception that it was used as a campaign song for President Reagan, Springsteen confirmed he did not authorise its use and was later criticised for it. Nevertheless, "Born in the U. S. A. " remains an enduring testament to the complexities of post-war life, leaving a lasting impression on both the nation and its people.
