An _expression_ is a single line of code that evaluates/results in a value.

The value that an express evaluates to may be:
1. a number
2. a string
3. a logical value

## Examples

**Number expressions:**

```js
2 + 2;
```

`2 + 2` is an expression that results in the value :`4`.


**String expressions:**

```js
"hello".toUpperCase();
```

`"hello".toUpperCase()` is an expression that results in the value: `HELLO`

```js
let firstName = "Dickweezle";
firstName;
> Dickweezle
```

`firstName` is an expression that results in / evaluates to the value  of "Dickweezle"  (from the variable binding above it).

**Logical expressions:**

```js
100 == 100;
```

`100 == 100` is an expression that results in the value: `true`
