# Python Functions

A Python function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. 

It's like a mini-program within a larger program, designed to perform a specific action when called. 

Functions help simplify code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## Creating a Function
In Python a function is defined using the `def` keyword:
```python
def my_function():
  print("Hola mundo!")
```

## Calling a Function

## Function parameters & arguments
A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

## Number of Arguments
By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 3 arguments, you have to call the function with 3 arguments, no more, no less.
