### Polk Audio Signature Series S30

![Polk Audio Signature Series S30.jpeg](../Users/devin/Desktop/Polk Audio Signature Series S30.jpeg "Polk Audio Signature Series S30.jpeg")

Polk Audio are a household name you’ll hear come up again and again when discussing home theater audio equipment. The S30 is the part of Polk’s popular signature series collection.

The lineup actually offers two center channel speakers, the S30 and S35. The S35 has a unique space efficient design that makes it useful for squeezing into places that lack vertical room. 

However, the S30 is more of a ‘true’ center speaker that gives it a fuller sound and is also cheaper. This is what we’d recommend for the vast majority of people for film or music, assuming space is not an issue.

#### **Key Features:**

* Two 5.25″ midrange drivers and one 1″ Terylene tweeter dome
* Patented Dual Power Port technology provides an extended bass port which makes for improved bass quality and more forgiving speaker placement
* Dynamic and slightly bright tone

### [JBL Arena 125C](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Arena-125C-Loudspeaker-Black/dp/B00W60RSWU)

![JBL Arena 125C 2-Way, Dual 5.5-Inch Center Channel Loudspeak.jpeg](../Users/devin/Desktop/JBL Arena 125C 2-Way, Dual 5.5-Inch Center Channel Loudspeak.jpeg)

JBL has grown an admirable reputation for manufacturing some of the most reliable and enjoyable sound systems for a variety of industries.

Their Arena 125C Center channel speaker combines the company’s definitive design traits with generous affordability.The speaker houses an impressive set of 5.25 ‘’ woofers that deliver highly reliable mid-to-low end response.

The speaker is manufactured using JBL’s signature sound profiling and is modeled on the excellent JBL M2 Master Reference Monitor.The Arena 125c also comes with an enhanced HDI function to improve the resolution and quality of downsampled information.

This feature can be hugely beneficial when listening to low-quality audio mixes. The JBL Arena 125c works very well when paired with the JBL 170 as left and right speakers. This center channel speaker is great for home, office, or studio use.

I am really impressed with the JBL Arena series. I have the sub, center and in wall speakers. These are budget speakers but perform on a par with much more expensive products. Match them with a decent receiver capable of pushing out 75 watts per channel or more and they perform very well in typical home theater rooms, bonus rooms, basements etc.  
  
I have my JBL center paired with an expensive pair ($2,000+) of floor standing left and right front speakers and they perform as part of that sound stage very well. They particularly excel at delivering clear dialog in movies and 5.1 channel audio. I personally wouldn't use a center for music applications as a I think pure stereo is more true to life but this speaker is good enough to deliver a full range of sound if you choose to.

### [Polk Audio T30](https://producerhive.com/polk-audio-t30/ "Polk Audio T30")

Polk is a US-based audio equipment company releasing competitive speaker systems since the early 1970s.

They offer considerably powerful, reliable speaker setups for their asking price, and their T30 center channel speaker offers terrific value for money.
 
The T30 delivers a noticeably balanced frequency response with a weighty low end. The T-30 has more than enough power for large rooms and doesn’t over-compress audio when pushed to high volumes.

Fans of vintage speaker models should enjoy the classic minimal aesthetic of the T30’s finish.This speaker forms part of Polk’s T series, which includes a handful of stereo speakers that can pair with the T30 for a complete home theater setup.

And well... these little speakers are the real deal. They have five-way speaker binding posts so you can plug in banana jacks or go old school with stripped wire. The grilles are removable, which is usually not seen at this price point. While I'm not usually a fan of black vinyl cabinets, these are executed tastefully and I have no problems with the looks at all. They have mounting holes on the backs so you can easily hang them on a wall.  
  
Let's cut to the chase! These sound fantastic! These are speakers you can listen to all day long, unlike some of the fancy stuff out there that has a long list of specs but doesn't quite make it in real life. You don't need a lot of power to play them, although I found that the better the amplification, the better they sounded.  
  
1. Bass is very, very good for not only a small speaker but a speaker in this price category. It took several hours before they really started singing--most brand-new speakers need a break-in period--but I cannot get over the bass response. Now, if you play them side by side with a subwoofer-equipped system, they're not going to be able to compete; however, I cannot stop listening to them and I have a system with a subwoofer.  
  
2. Overall sound is superb. I can hear plenty of details in my favorite music that I thought only expensive speakers could capture. There's a good sound stage, highs are not harsh or fatiguing, midrange sounds great to me. Am I an audiophile? Probably not, since I will never spend more than a mortgage payment on a piece of hi-fi gear and I use 12AWG Monoprice speaker cables, but I love music and I listen to it every day.  
  
3. A comparison: I saved up for a pair of Wharfedale Dentons. These are not budget speakers. Originally retailing for $1,000 pr., they can often be had for $500 or less and are stunning, well-regarded speakers. The Polk Audio T15s sounder better. Yep. I'm sure a squad of hitmen from Stereophile (and Wharfedale) are prepping their weapons as I write this, but the Dentons cannot handle bass like the Polks do. Are the Dentons drop dead gorgeous in their veneered, bomb-proof cabinets? Yes! Do the Dentons sound good? Yes, again, but I cannot listen to the Dentons very long before I put something else in their place. They simply cannot deal with bass in a pleasing manner and yes, they've done as much breaking in as they're ever going to do. Please understand that I'm not knocking the Dentons; they are so well-made I want to cry, but the Polks are more enjoyable to listen to.  
  
4. So, what's the deal? What's the catch? I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, so let's get it over with...  There's no catch that I can see so far, except that these are mass-produced, black vinyl speakers. They are not exotic and I doubt Stereophile is going to review them any time soon. They aren't going to fill a concert hall with thundering bass because they're small bookshelf speakers. Some audio snob types are not going to even bother to listen to a pair because they don't cost enough. Well, their loss is our gain, my friends, because if I had known about these speakers before buying the damned Dentons (and some other fancy speakers) I could have saved $400.  
  
5. Not enough bass for you? No problem. For $130 shipped, buy the Polk Audio PSW10 subwoofer. I am a card-carrying bass freak (every single amp and receiver I own has the bass knob maxed out and I usually have loudness engaged as well) and this thing is a damned marvel. It was easy to set up and yes, it will work with old amps and receivers. You can adjust how much or how little bass it puts out, and for once in my life I DO NOT have the bass turned all the way up--that's how powerful this thing is. You can set it on standby mode, where it's "asleep" until it senses a music signal, then it turns on and does it's thing. That said, the T15's sound so nice on their own I'd hold off on the sub and judge for yourself.  
  
I have heard many different speakers over the years, from Bose 901s to Martin Logan Prefaces to Polk Audio LSi9's, and these are absolutely the best value I've ever heard in speakers. They are cheap enough that you can buy two pairs and have a speaker in every corner of the room. Bass is handled very well and they sound good enough to be the main speakers in a two-channel hi-fi system. Look at how many people have given these speakers two thumbs up! I cannot stress how wonderful it is that Polk Audio has provided such an amazing, low-cost speaker to the general public. I highly recommend these speakers. Just remember to let them play for a few hours and the better the amplification, the better they'll sound.


### Klipsch R-52C Center Channel Home Speaker

![Klipsch R-52C Center Channel Home Speaker.jpeg](../Users/devin/Desktop/Klipsch R-52C Center Channel Home Speaker.jpeg)

Klipsch are probably the biggest name in home theater, and the R-52C is their best-selling center channel speaker. Klipsch are known for their use of horn-loaded speakers which are high sensitivity and capable of producing a high dynamic range.

The result? A center channel speaker that few speakers can match in terms of pure loudness or liveliness. The major success of Klipsch can be partly attributed to their signature sound’s ‘wow’ factor, which makes them sound loud and vibrant which makes them especially good for watching action movies. However be warned, the bright and slightly oversaturated tones has opinions split.

**Key Features:**

* Dual 5. 25-inch Spun-copper img woofers
* 1-inch aluminum tweeter mated to a 90x90 square tractrix horn
* 89Hz – 21kHz frequency response range
* Impressive 400 watts power handling

**Pros:**

* High sensitivity speakers which can deliver high volume levels and heart thumping bass without the need for a powerful amplifier.
* High dynamic range – Rich variance in minimum and maximum volume levels (especially important in cinema audio)

**Cons:**

* The signature Klipsch sound may be a little bright and fatiguing for some listeners
* Slightly colored sound means they are best matched with Klipsch surround speakers for a consistent tone


### [Klipsch RP-504C](https://www.amazon.com/Klipsch-RP-504C-Center-Channel-Speaker/dp/B07G3B5W8Y)

![Klipsch RP-504C Center Channel Speaker (.jpeg](../Users/devin/Desktop/Klipsch RP-504C Center Channel Speaker (.jpeg)

Klipsch proprietary Tractrix horn-loaded technology ensures high-frequency energy of the Reference Premiere center channel speakers are aimed directly at the listener and reduces unwanted, artificial reverb caused by indirect sound bouncing off walls - meaning you experience the most clear, detailed, lifelike sound possible.

The vented tweeter housing reduces standing waves that create unwanted harmonics, resulting in enhanced detail and clarity in high frequency reproduction.

When combined the cleanest most natural sound possible is created. Linear Travel Suspension (LTS) Titanium Diaphragm Tweeter The exclusive Linear Travel Suspension minimizes distortion for enhanced detailed performance. 

Spun Copper Cerametallic Woofers A signature feature on the Reference Premiere series Cerametallic woofers are exceptionally rigid and lightweight for minimal distortion and maximum efficiency. 

When paired with the Tractrix horn-loaded LTS tweeter it provides the highest speaker efficiency in its class. Tractrix Ports Utilizing Tractrix geometry the Reference Premiere ports allow for the most efficient fastest air transfer from the cabinet which reduces port noise for punchier low frequencies. Klipsch Tractrix ports have custom designed inner flares that help reduce air turbulence entering the port.

I paired the RP-504C with RP-8000Fs, RP-500Ms, and an HSU VTF2-MK5 with Denon AVR. While the Klipsch brand is great, the RP-504C was a great speaker and it did enhance the sound. HOWEVER, it also directed all the sound to the center so much so, that the left, right and surround channels got drowned out. Nothing I did with my AVR could bring it back. The Audassey setup did ask if I wanted to expand the center to the Left and Right channels and I chose "No". When I wanted to set it back there was no option to do that, unless I ran the Audassey setup again.  
  
So while this DOES sound great and it did improve the center sound, I felt I lost the fidelity of the left/right and surround channels. This made it sound as if the center was over pronounced. Once disconnected I got back that big theater sound I was used to. I do want a center channel, just not one that "hogs" the middle ground and the sound stage, in my opinion. So the RP-504C was too big for my setup. So I learned that I should have gotten the RP-404C (or an earlier model) for my particular setup.

### [Sony SSCS8](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-SSCS8-3-Driver-Channel-Speaker/dp/B00O8YLNRS)

![Sony SSCS8.jpg](../Users/devin/Desktop/Sony SSCS8.jpg)

Prepare yourself for natural sounding vocals that shoot straight to the heart, thanks to the all-new Wide Dispersion Super Tweeter. The super tweeter is specifically designed to deliver ultra-responsive, high-frequency audio response (up to 50 kHz), ideal for High-Resolution listening, with wide directionality (sweet spot).

High-quality crossover networks using specially selected components assure minimal signal loss for energetic vocal response with even the most delicate emotional nuances. While being carefully mounted directly to the cabinet for vibration isolation.

Natural bass is realized through precise timing alignment across the entire frequency range. One listen and you will be mesmerized by the incredibly fast and powerful bass response that not only gives your music a solid foundation—it rocks your senses!

These speakers are a great value. The bass is quite incredible. In fact, I usually have the bass nearly turned all the way down when watching tv since I live in an apartment. I know how annoying a constant thumping can be from the bass of someone's television. These speakers do about everything your groovy uncle's floor speakers did in the 70s with the exception of high-range tweeters. But if you're looking for a pair of bookshelf speakers that fill the room, these are the real deal. The treble is great for the size of the speakers. These speakrs are very loud. Just be sure to match the speakers appropriately with a receiver that can deliver the wattage, and get the right sized gauged wiring. You'll likely not regret purchasing these.


### [Pioneer SP-C22](https://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-SP-C22-Designed-Channel-Speaker/dp/B008NCD2EI)

![Pioneer SP-C22.jpeg](../Users/devin/Desktop/Pioneer SP-C22.jpeg)

Designed by Pioneer's Chief Speaker Engineer, Andrew Jones, this speaker comes with a remarkable pedigree of over 70 years of Pioneer audio heritage and industry firsts. The SP-C22 gives you incredible design with amazing sound quality.

The SP-C22 utilizes a true curved cabinet design resulting in a stiffer cabinet wall. This reduces standing sound waves inside, resulting in high-performance and striking sound quality.

The SP-C22 delivers crisper dialogue, crunchier car crashes, and louder explosions at every movie night.

The center channel sounds good for the price. Slightly harsh treble (grainy, sizzly and thin) and the midrange woofers are a little flat sounding (lacking air, depth and crispness) but clear, balanced and detailed enough to be well worth the money. 

I think I can do a little better for a little more $ but it gives enough vocal detail for movies that I don't care enough to replace it. Just ok for music, nothing spectacular but then again I can't place it properly and optimize it's sound due to it's enormous size, so it sits on the table top with my tv behind it until I can find a tv stand that will accommodate a 7 1/4" + high center channel for under $1000... good luck! Regardless the treble is a bit harsh and placement won't do much for that - It needs a smoother, fuller, tweeter and a little bit smaller box.


### Klipsch KC-25 Center Channel Speaker

![Klipsch-KC-25-Center-Channel-Speaker.jpeg](../Users/devin/Desktop/Klipsch-KC-25-Center-Channel-Speaker.jpeg)

The Klipsch KC-25 is one of the best center channel speakers that can fill your room with powerful lifelike sound output. It pairs very well with most stereo left and right speakers in a surround sound setup to create an immersive listening experience with deep sound effects. The high efficient design of the speakers produce great output without consuming less energy. 

The sound output on these speakers goes very loud and can easily fill up a large room with sound. This center channel speaker comes with an enhanced 1-inch aluminium tweeter paired with two high-output 5.25” woofers which provides crisp highs and deep bass. 

The size of the speaker is very compact with dimensions 7.25” H x 18.75” W x 7.25” D. This speaker is well-constructed and blends in nicely with modern home interior decor in a home theater setting with a modern cabinet design. On the whole, the Klipsch KC-25 are some of the best center channel speakers that deliver clear vocals and lifelike sound quality and are worth getting for your surround sound system.

The Klipsch KC-25 center channel speaker provides an immersive listening experience with powerful sound with low distortion even at higher volumes. These center channel speakers integrates easily into a home theatre setup and delivers crystal clear dialogue for movies. 

The Klipsch KC-25 features proprietary Tractrix Horn technology that provides a combination of clear, precise and clean sound with plenty of details. It is capable of producing plenty of volume output and fill up a large room with clear dialogues without any distortion. The dialogues are clear and life-like and provide a cinematic listening experience. 

We also enjoyed listening to classical music and orchestra performances which sound almost as if we were sitting in a music hall. We also liked the fact that these speakers have controlled directivity and wide dynamic range for directional output towards the person sitting in the room. 

The aluminium tweeters comes with a linear travel suspension that allow high-frequency driver that can move back and forth seamlessly. This creates faster frequency response and a much wider listening curve.



## Using Center Channel Speakers

* **Speaker placement will play a considerable role in the playback quality of your home theater systems**. Ensure that your center channel sits right in the middle of your speaker setup with even spacing between left and right speakers. 
* **Use as little connection cable as possible when linking your speaker to the amplifier**. The longer your speaker cable, the more power your amp has to emit reliable sound quality. Most speaker setups require a 14-gauge electric cable for efficient power transmission. 
* **A single subwoofer should generally provide sufficient bass for a balanced playback on most home theater systems**. Place your subwoofer in the same areas as your center channel speaker. Center channel speakers often perform best when placed directly above a subwoofer for a balanced stereo image. 
* **When placing your center channel speaker, keep other objects as far away from the front as possible**. You want to create as much space as possible in front of your center channel speaker to avoid obstructing playback and causing unwanted acoustic reflections. 
* **Try to keep your speakers in an area that is free from excessive amounts of dust, moisture, and smoke**. These factors all shorten the lifespan of the average speaker.

## What to look for when buying center channel speakers?

Now you know how important having a center channel speaker is, let’s have a look at things you need to consider before making a purchase.

### Performance

It sounds quite obvious but looking into how channel speakers actually perform is an important step before buying.

One thing you should look at is the frequency range. It is best to look at a speaker that has a wide frequency range because this will ensure clear audio, especially with dialogue. It means that people sitting directly in front of the speaker as well as those that aren’t facing it will get a good audio experience.

### Size

Something else to think about is the actual size of the channel speaker itself.

The amount of space you have available to house it is going to determine how big or small a speaker you can have. Just because a center channel speaker is pretty small in size doesn’t necessarily mean its performance is poorer than a bigger model.

This also relates to how big a room you are putting your speakers in. As we’ve seen before, some [speakers for small rooms](https://allsoundlab.net/the-best-speakers-for-small-rooms/) are more than adequate for the space you have and actually provide as good an experience as physically larger speakers.

### Aesthetics

Even though performance and audio quality are the main things most people look at with any type of speakers, aesthetics can be important too.

If you are going for a specific design in your living room then you will want a center channel speaker to match it. This is especially true if you have surround speakers already there. You won’t want to mess up the aesthetic of the speaker system by buying a center channel speaker that looks really out of place.

While the look of the speaker might not always be high up on your list, give it some consideration. You don’t want to purchase one and then have to return it because it really messes up the design of your home.

### Compatibility

As your center channel speaker is going to need to link up to your wider audio set up, you need to make sure that it is actually compatible with everything else.

This isn’t as straightforward as you might think. Even if you buy from the same company as the rest of your home theater, compatibility isn’t always assured. As you probably don’t want to have to return a center channel speaker because it doesn’t integrate properly, make sure to do your research first.

If it isn’t clear that the speaker you are thinking of buying works with your surround sound system, contact customer service to be on the safe side. Most speakers that are of the same brand should be compatible with each other but it is always best to check it out anyway.

### Sensitivity

Sensitivity is another important specification to consider with a center channel speaker.

It relates to how loud the speaker is going to be. Usually, you will see this laid out in decibels (dB) on the specifications section for each speaker.

The average sensitivity is usually around 88db however you can find lower and higher sensitivity ratings. You shouldn’t just choose a speaker based on its sensitivity rating but it should be taken into consideration. Other factors can impact what speaker you go for in regards to its sensitivity such as the size of the room and how loud you need the audio to be.

## FAQs

### Can You Use Any Speaker For The Center Channel?

No. Center channel speakers come with a specific configuration that allows them to adequately process audio directly from the center channel feed from a mixer or amplifier.

Using other speakers will result in a diminished audio playback quality or a lack of audio information during playback,

### Can You Use A Center Speaker Alone?

While you can use a center channel speaker for certain movies, music, or games, you won’t be able to receive a true stereo image and full-quality audio without the addition of left and right speakers.

Specific playback devices can be configured to exclusively send the entire audio feed through the center channels speaker.

### Can I Replace The Center Channel Speaker With A Soundbar?

Yes, it is possible to substitute your center channel speaker with a soundbar. 

However in most instances, we don’t recommend it as soundbars are often designed to be all-in-one solutions with their own upwards firing drivers, side-firing drivers and incorporate Dolby Atmos surround which may conflict with your existing surround sound setup.

You must connect your soundbar with its appropriate connection (HDMI, RCA, etc) and then configure your playback device accordingly.

### Is A Center Channel Good For Music?

By themselves, center channel speakers will provide clear, defined sound, but you won’t experience its full stereo width (the way its intended to be listened to).

Center channel speakers are an excellent option for music listening when used in conjunction with the compatible left and right surround sound speakers.

### What are center channel speakers for?

A center channel speaker acts to balance the audio out between the left and right channels. Surround Sound audio formats have specifically encoded center channel audio for more accurate spatial sound, and it is often the channel with the most developed dialogue sound. As a result, they help your system produce more dynamic sound, clearer dialog and deliver a more enjoyable audio experience overall.
