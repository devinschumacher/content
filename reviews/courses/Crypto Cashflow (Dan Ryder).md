## The People Behind The System

In 2013, Dan created his own company called Ryder Media, and got involved with crypto about 3 years ago. Dan put his own spin on a way of earning with crypto currencies that most people miss. He figured out some strategies that reward him daily and even said that if he was to start all over online, he would not do it as a marketer but this method of crypto earning instead.
