## Server-side event handler

An 'event handler for server-side routes' is a function that processes incoming HTTP requests on the server side of a web application.

**A function that:**
1. is triggered when an HTTP requests is made to a specific URL on a server
2. Receives information about the request (headers, body etc.)
3. Processes the request information (often interacting with databases or other services)
4. Formulates + sends back an appropriate HTTP response


- **Server-side**: This means the code runs on the web server, not in the user's browser.
- **Routes**: In web development, routes are the URLs or endpoints that a web application responds to. For example, "/users" or "/products/123" could be routes.
- **Event**:  In this context, an "event" is an incoming HTTP request. T
- **Event handler**: The event handler is a function that gets called when this event (request) occurs.
