# Port Scanning

In computer science, a port is a communication endpoint. When an application is running on the computer, it opens a port.

This port acts as an address using which applications can interact with each other.

**Here are a few examples:**

- TeamViewer opens the following ports: 80, 443 and 5938 (TCP)
- RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) opens this port: 3389 (TCP and UDP)

A port can be any number from 0 to 65535.

Websites that utilize local open port scanning through web sockets can see what ports are open in a particular computer, and as a result, understand what program our users are running.

According to research by Multilogin.com - Facebook, eBay, and Amazon are using this fingerprinting method.
