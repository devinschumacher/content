# DreamBooth: Text-to-Image AI with Stable Diffusion

DreamBooth is a deep learning generation model created in 2022 by researchers from Google Research and Boston University to improve on text-to-image conversion algorithms already in use. 

DreamBooth implementations, which were initially created using Google's own Imagen text-to-image model, may be applied to other text-to-image models, enabling the model to produce more specialized and individualized outputs after training on three to five photographs of a subject.

## DreamBooth Background (done)
Text-to-image systems that have been trained as "Diffusion models" are capable of producing a wide variety of image output types, but they lack the specificity needed to produce images of uncommon subjects and have a limited ability to represent well-known subjects in a variety of situations and contexts.

DreamBooth implementations are run through a process that involves fine-tuning such models using a small collection of images that illustrate a specific topic. Three to five images are typically enough, and these images are coupled with text prompts that indicate the name of the class.

Even models like DALL-E2 models cannot reconstruct or ability to modify the model. On the other hand, our method (right) can synthesize the clock with greater accuracy and in unusual settings (_"a [V] clock in the jungle"_).

To encourage the model to provide different examples of the subject depending on what the model has already trained on for the original class, a class-specific prior preservation loss is utilized.

Pairs of low-resolution and high-resolution images taken from the set of input images are used to fine-tune the components, allowing the minute details of the subject to be maintained.


## Capabilities (done)

DreamBooth can be used to fine-tune models like, where it may ease a common limitation of Stable Diffusion's inability to generate photos of unique persons.

However, such a use case is exceedingly taxing and, as a result, too expensive for hobbyist users.

The Stable Diffusion adaptation in DreamBooth, in particular, is based on the principle outlined in the original paper published in 2022 by Ruiz et al.

Concerns have been raised concerning the ability of unscrupulous individuals to utilize DreamBooth to generate false images for criminal ends, as well as the open-source nature of the technology, which allows anybody to use or even improve it.

Artists have also expressed worries about the morality of using DreamBooth to train model checkpoints that are specifically designed to copy specific painting forms associated with individual artists. 

### Art Rendition

### Property Modification

We show color modifications in the first row (using prompts \`\`a \[color\] \[V\] car''), and crosses between a specific dog and different animals in the second row (using prompts \`\`a cross of a \[V\] dog and a \[target species\]''). We highlight the fact that our method preserves unique visual features that give the subject its identity or essence, while performing the required property modification.


### Accessorization

Outfitting an with accessories.
