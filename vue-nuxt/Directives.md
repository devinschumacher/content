- A 'special' html attribute that starts with `v-` prefix; part of the Vue template syntax: `<div v-bind:id="dynamicId"></div>`
- The part after the colon (`:`)  is the 'argument' of the directive.

## Directives:

- `v-bind:`

-`v-on:` - listens to DOM events

- `v-model`: two way binding for forms. automatically syncs theÂ `<input>`'s value with the bound state, so we no longer need to use an event handler for that.
