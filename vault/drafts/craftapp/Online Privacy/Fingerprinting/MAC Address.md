# MAC Address

A unique identifier for a device's wireless adapter.

## What is a MAC Address?

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a device's hardware or wireless adapter, and serves as the device's ‘physical’ address on a network.

The MAC address is a 12-character sequence, usually expressed as six pairs of hexadecimal characters and is used to identify and authenticate the device to the network and other connected devices.

The MAC Address is assigned by the device’s manufacturer and can never be changed.

Each device, from computers to phones, will have a different MAC address, allowing network administrators to keep track of which devices are connected to their networks.

When a device sends data over the network, the MAC address is included in the communication packet so that the recipient is able to receive the packet. This allows computers, phones and other devices on the same network to communicate with each other.

A MAC address can also be used to restrict access to certain network resources. For example, network administrators can set up MAC address filtering to limit access to specific networks or devices on a network.

It’s important to note that, while MAC addresses are useful for identifying device and providing a level of network security, they can also provide access to personal data if in the wrong hands, as a MAC address can be used to track a device and, ultimately, its user.

### How it is different from an IP Address

A MAC address is different from an IP address in that an IP address is used to identify a device on the internet, while a MAC address is used to identify a device on the local network.

IP addresses can be changed, while MAC addresses are unique and permanent.

MAC addresses are used to ensure efficient and secure communication on a local network, while IP addresses are used for communication between networks.

### The format of a MAC Address

A MAC address is composed of 12 characters divided into six groups and represented in hexadecimal format.

- A MAC address is usually written like this: XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX.
- For example, a MAC address might look like this: 08-00-27-00-80-90.

The first three groups are called the **Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)** and are assigned to a given network device manufacturer by the **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers).**

The last three groups are the individual device's identifier, and are assigned by the manufacturer. The combination of the OUI and the device identifier is what makes the MAC address unique.

# How is it Used to Identify People Online?

Sites can use MAC addresses to track a user's online activity by collecting and storing the MAC address of a user's device whenever they access the site.

This allows the site to keep track of the user's activity over time. The MAC address can be used in conjunction with other methods, such as IP addresses and cookies, to build a profile of the user and their online behaviour.

This data can then be used to deliver targeted marketing messages or tailored content to the user. It can also be used to block certain sites or content that the user may not want to access.

# What Can be Done to Prevent Detection?

One way to prevent detection is to use a trusted VPN service provider.

A VPN changes your IP address, which makes it difficult for anyone to trace your online activities back to you. It also makes it harder to detect when you are visiting certain websites or apps that are blocked or monitored in your location.

Additionally, if you use a reputable VPN, they will use encryption protocols to ensure that your data remains secure and private.

Other prevention techniques include disabling scripts and plug-ins that are not necessary, deleting browsing and search histories, and using a secure browser.
