In Linux, a multiplexer (often abbreviated as "mux") refers to a software tool that allows multiple virtual terminals or sessions to share a single physical terminal or console.

It enables users to switch between different terminal sessions without the need to open new windows or log in multiple times.

The most commonly used multiplexer in Linux is called "tmux" (short for terminal multiplexer).

It is a command-line tool that can be used to manage multiple terminal sessions, windows, and panes within a single terminal window. With tmux, users can split their terminal window into multiple panes, each running its own command or program.

Tmux provides many useful features such as session management, pane and window manipulation, and detachable sessions. It also allows users to customize the appearance and behavior of their terminal environment.

Multiplexers like tmux are especially useful for system administrators and developers who need to manage multiple terminal sessions simultaneously.

By using a multiplexer, they can avoid the overhead of opening multiple terminal windows or SSH sessions to remote servers.
