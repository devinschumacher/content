# Integration Tests

These tests focus on the interactions between different units or components of a software system. The goal is to ensure that these components work together as expected.



Integration tests typically involve combining two or more units of code and testing them as a group. If you test the individual units and then you test that the units are connected together correctly you've covered nearly everything.



These tests are usually conducted after unit tests (which test individual components in isolation) to ensure that the units work together correctly.
