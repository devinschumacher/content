# HTML Attributes

---

HTML elements can have **attributes.**

HTML attributes give more information to the HTML tags. 

Think of “attributes” kind of like “adjectives” in English grammar - they provide additional information.

For example, let’s say you have a ‘hyperlink’ HTML element. 

It would normally look something like this:

`<a href="https://devinschumacher.com/">Devin's Website</a>`

This would show up in a browser like this: [Devin’s Website](http://devinschumacher.com)

Well, what if you wanted to give a little more information to this link, such as “when someone clicks this link, make sure you open it in a new tab!”

In this case you would add an HTML attribute to this HTML element, `target="_blank"`

It would go inside of the HTML element, like this:

`<a href="https://devinschumacher.com/" target="_blank">Devin's Website</a>`
