# Application Programming Interface (API)

Module: Glossary

REST APIs enable 2-way communication between a client & an API server.

- **API**: An API, or Application Programming Interface, allows different software systems to communicate with each other and exchange data through a pre-defined a set of rules and standards for communication to make things easy to understand and operate.
- **Client**: The 'client' in this case is usually the 'web browser' (person using the computer's web browser) sending a request for something from a program - a program that is receiving communication via the API.
- **REST API**: A REST API, or Representational State Transfer API, is a type of web API that uses HTTP requests & responses to communicate back and forth between the API server and the client.

In short, APIs are ways for computers to communicate with servers, and send data back and forth through requests & responses.
