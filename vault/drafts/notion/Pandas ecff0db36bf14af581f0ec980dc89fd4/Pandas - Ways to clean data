# Pandas - Ways to clean data

| empty cells in rows | remove the rows with empty cells | df.dropna() | One way to deal with empty cells is to remove rows that contain empty cells. This is usually OK, since data sets can be very big, and removing a few rows will not have a big impact on the result. |

```python
# df.dropna()

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

new_df = df.dropna()

print(new_df.to_string())

```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ By default, theÂ `dropna()`Â method returns aÂ *new*Â DataFrame, and will not change the original.

</aside>

```python
# df.dropna(inplace = True)

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.dropna(inplace = True)

print(df.to_string()))
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `dropna(inplace = True)`Â will NOT return a new DataFrame, but it will remove all rows containing NULL values from the original DataFrame.
