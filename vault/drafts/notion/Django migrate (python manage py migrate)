# Django migrate (python manage.py migrate)

The `migrate` command applies migrations for all applications listed in `INSTALLED_APPS` (that haven’t been applied) (Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called **`django_migrations`**)

It synchronizes the database with the current `models` and existing migrations (from `makemigrations`).

The three-step guide to making model changes:

1. Change your models (in **`models.py`**).
2. Run **`python manage.py makemigrations`** to create migrations for those changes
3. Run **`python manage.py migrate`** to apply those changes to the database.
