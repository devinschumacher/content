# SQL IS NULL

---

`IS NULL`
 is a **[logical operator](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-logical-operators)**
 in SQL that allows you to exclude rows with missing data from your results.

You can select rows that do not have any data in a given column with `IS NULL`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM <table_name>
WHERE <field> IS NULL;
```

Notice that we are using `WHERE field IS NULL` and not `WHERE field = NULL`.

The latter will not work because you cannot perform arithmetic operations on NULL values.
