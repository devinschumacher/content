# Writesonic

[Writesonic][1] offers a plethora of AI-powered writing tools, allowing you to create a wide range of content without breaking a sweat. 

From generating articles and blog posts to crafting eCommerce product descriptions and ads, Writesonic has got you covered.

## TLDR: Not Recommended

Writesonic was one of the earlier tools that I remember seeing. 

They've been out for a while, and I tried them a long time ago. 

Let me give it to you straight...

They are now backed by Y-Combinator and have received a bunch of investment money - but in the beginning they had an "unlimited plan" which I signed up for. 

Soon after I received an email saying "you're using this tool too much" and they took away my credits. 

So, I can never in good conscience recommend you work with this company. They are shitty.

And they are just a clone 100s of other content writing tools out there - so do yourself and the world a favor and give your money to someone else.

With that being said, let's go look at a "matter-of-fact" view of Writesonic.

Other than that, I would probably give it a recommendation of "try it out", so if you wanna give them a chance, [click here and see for yourself][2].

But, if it were me... I would go with [CopyAI][3] or [Jasper][4]

## Company Overview

Writesonic is a platform that uses AI technology to simplify the writing process for individuals and businesses alike. The platform was founded by Samanyou, a tech enthusiast who recognized the challenges that many people face when it comes to writing compelling content.

Samanyou's initial breakthrough came in October 2020 when he developed an AI-powered landing page generator using Open AI's GPT-3. This tool quickly gained attention and became one of the most popular AI writers available. 

In January 2021, Samanyou launched the Writesonic AI Article/Blog Writer, which leverages the same technology to produce high-quality content for blogs and articles.

The Writesonic platform has been recognized as the "Best AI Writer of 2021" (now "Best AI Writer of 2022") by TechRadar and other reputable media publications. 

As the CEO of Writesonic, Samanyou is committed to continuing to enhance the platform's capabilities and making writing accessible to everyone, regardless of their experience or background.
