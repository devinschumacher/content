## What is CBD Payment Processing?

CBD payment processing enables businesses like yours to accept various forms of payment, including credit cards. Without such services, you'd be limited to cash and checks.

Partnering with a payment processing company that specializes in high-risk industries—like CBD—can help you reach a broader customer base and boost your sales.

## Processing Payments for CBD Businesses: An Absolute Must

Most consumers prefer using credit or debit cards for transactions, making it crucial for your business to accept these payment methods.

High-risk enterprises, such as those dealing in CBD products, must collaborate with payment processors equipped to handle their specific needs.

## Payment Processing Options for CBD Businesses

You have several choices for processing payments in-store and online, and you can combine these options based on your business requirements.

### In-Person Transactions via POS Systems

If your CBD business operates from a physical location, a POS system or credit card terminal is essential. These systems accommodate EMV chip cards, magstripe cards, and mobile wallets like Apple Pay.

POS systems offer additional benefits, such as inventory management, payroll handling, and employee scheduling.

### Online Payments Using a Virtual Terminal

For those who prefer not to use a POS system, a virtual terminal is a practical alternative. This system operates online, allowing you to enter customer payment details manually.

Virtual terminals are versatile and can handle phone orders (MOTO payments) as well as in-store sales.

### Payment Gateways for Online Stores

If your CBD business is online, you'll need a payment gateway. This system integrates with your online store’s shopping cart, managing transactions seamlessly as customers enter their payment information.

Payment gateways can also be integrated into mobile apps if your store offers one.

### Mobile Payment Processing

For CBD retailers who need to process payments on the go, mobile payment processing services are ideal.

This involves using a mobile app or card reader to handle transactions, which is useful for trade shows or farmers markets.

## Merchant Account Providers vs. Payment Aggregators

Many merchants prefer payment aggregators like Square or PayPal, but these can be problematic for high-risk businesses. Issues include:

* Frozen Funds: Excessive chargebacks can lead to frozen funds, creating significant problems for your business.
* High Fees: Payment aggregators often charge higher fees compared to merchant account providers.
* Account Termination: Aggregators may shut down accounts, leading to loss of funds, a common issue for high-risk merchants.
    

Some payment aggregators, like PayPal, do not support CBD transactions, and attempting to deceive them about your products could lead to account closure and fund loss.

## Key Considerations When Choosing a CBD Merchant Services Provider

### Transaction Fees and Costs

Opening a merchant account involves various fees, including:

* Application and approval fees
* Monthly statement fees
* Monthly and/or annual fees
* PCI compliance fees
* Payment gateway fees
* Virtual terminal fees
    

Transaction fees typically depend on the payment method used. For instance, a transaction with an EMV chip card might incur fees of 3.99% + $0.50.

### Rolling Reserve Requirements

High-risk merchant accounts often require rolling reserves, where a percentage of your sales is held in reserve for six months to cover potential chargebacks.

After six months, some of these funds may be returned to you, but some providers may maintain this requirement throughout the contract.

### Contract Length and Terms

Most providers will require a contract. Be sure to understand the contract's terms, including fees and cancellation conditions.

Avoid long-term contracts if possible, as early termination fees can be substantial.

## Questions to Ask Potential Payment Processors

### What Pricing Model Do You Use?

Payment processors offer various pricing models:

* Flat-Rate Pricing: A single rate for all transactions, simplifying accounting but potentially higher overall costs.
* Tiered Pricing: Charges vary based on transaction categories (qualified, mid-qualified, non-qualified), with non-qualified transactions incurring higher rates.
* Interchange-Plus Pricing: Transparent model where fees are based on credit card company rates plus an additional processor fee.
    

### How Long Will Setup Take?

Determine how quickly you can start processing payments. Some high-risk providers can set up your account within days, while others may take up to 14 days for equipment delivery.

Account approval can be completed in as little as 24 hours.

### What Hardware/Software Is Available?

Inquire about available hardware and software, and avoid leasing equipment if possible. Buying outright can save money.

## Choosing the Right CBD Merchant Account Provider

When evaluating payment processors, consider the following:

* Customer Service and Support: Reliable support is crucial for resolving issues.
* Accepted Payment Types: Ensure the processor supports a variety of payment methods, including mobile wallets.
* Fraud Protection: Your provider should help you maintain PCI compliance to protect customer data.
    

## A Few More Thoughts Before We Go...

### Acknowledge CBD’s High-Risk Nature

CBD businesses are categorized as high-risk due to the legal ambiguities surrounding CBD products.

This designation means higher processing costs. However, investing time in researching the best merchant account providers can maximize your profits and ensure you receive the services you need.

### Plan for Future Growth

Consider potential future expansions, such as online sales, and choose a payment processor that can accommodate your evolving needs.

## Securing the Right Partner for Your CBD Business

Choosing the right payment processor is crucial for the success of your CBD business. With the unique challenges that come with high-risk merchant status, partnering with a provider that understands these nuances is essential.

Easy Pay Direct, PaymentCloud, and eMerchantBroker each offer valuable services that cater to the specific needs of CBD merchants.

By selecting a provider that aligns with your business goals and processing requirements, you can enhance your transaction capabilities and set your business up for long-term success.
