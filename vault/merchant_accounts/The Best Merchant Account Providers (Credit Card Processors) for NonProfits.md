## What is a Nonprofit Merchant Account?

A [nonprofit business](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp) operates with a mission to support a cause and provide social benefits, qualifying for a tax-exempt status from the IRS.

These entities are often classified as 501(C)(3) organizations, encompassing hospitals, national charities, foundations, religious institutions, and scientific organizations.

A nonprofit merchant account allows these organizations to process credit card payments.

While some nonprofits might opt for popular payment processors without thorough comparison, selecting a processor tailored to their specific needs can offer substantial benefits.

## Why Nonprofits Need Credit Card Processing

Nonprofits require the ability to accept credit card payments for several reasons:

* **Collecting Donations**: This is a primary reason. Donors often prefer to contribute via credit card, both in person and online.
* **Selling Event Tickets**: Fundraising events, such as galas or community runs, often necessitate credit card payment options for ticket sales.
* **Selling Merchandise**: Nonprofits frequently sell branded merchandise or event-specific items. Offering credit card payments, either online or in person, enhances convenience and can boost sales.
* **Collecting Membership Fees**: Some nonprofits offer memberships, and accepting credit card payments can facilitate automatic, recurring fee collection.
    

## Choosing a Nonprofit Payment Processor

### Pricing and Contracts

Every nonprofit has unique needs. If your organization only requires seasonal or temporary credit card processing, look for processors without contracts or monthly fees.

Some processors provide discounted rates for nonprofits, which might apply to transaction or chargeback fees.

Additionally, consider the costs of hardware and software; some companies offer outright purchases, while others charge recurring lease fees.

### Payment Options

Ensure the payment processor supports major credit cards—Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover—and consider other digital payment forms. You may need to accept:

* **ACH or E-checks**: Direct bank transfers.
* **Ecommerce Payments**: Online gateways for website donations.
* **Contactless Payments**: Digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay.
    

Understanding your donor preferences now and in the future will help in selecting the right payment options.

### Value-Added Services

Integrating your payment processor with fundraising databases can be crucial. Some processors offer CRM software to help manage donor information or integrate with existing systems.

Security is also paramount; ensure your processor complies with PCI Data Security Standards to protect your data and that of your donors.

Additionally, the speed at which funds are deposited can be vital, especially for nonprofits dependent on cash flow.

### Reputation

Choose a payment processor with a solid reputation. Review feedback from other merchants to gauge their experiences.

Check if the processor is listed with the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/overview-of-bbb-ratings) (BBB) for additional insights into their history and customer service quality.

Even if not accredited, their BBB page can reveal complaint histories and operational longevity.

### Customer Service

Effective customer service can be critical if issues arise. Opt for a processor offering multiple support channels, such as email, phone, and online help desks.

Determine their support hours to ensure assistance aligns with your operational needs. Exceptional customer service can significantly impact your overall experience with the payment processor.

### Easy Setup

Nonprofits often lack the time for extensive staff training on new systems.

Select a processor that offers a straightforward setup and minimal training requirements to ensure smooth implementation without heavy time investments.

## Types of Payment Processing Available to Nonprofits

Venturing into payment processing can be overwhelming, especially for nonprofits unfamiliar with the various options.

Depending on the specific needs of your organization, you might require a processor capable of handling multiple payment methods.

### POS Systems

Point of Sale (POS) systems are essential tools that facilitate transactions with customers.

While some businesses may only require software, typically both POS hardware and software are needed, particularly for in-person transactions.

### Hardware

POS hardware varies widely, with each type offering unique benefits.

Here are some hardware options to consider:

* **Touch Screen POS System**: This is the most common POS setup, resembling a traditional cash register but with a digital screen. It often includes additional peripherals like a receipt printer or a barcode scanner.
* **Mobile Card Reader**: Ideal for on-the-go transactions, such as at trade shows or outdoor events. This small device connects to a smartphone and can swipe or tap credit cards.
* **Credit Card Terminal**: A straightforward, stationary device dedicated to processing credit cards at a fixed location.
    

### Software

Advanced POS software can offer more than just transaction recording; it can enhance overall business management.

Potential features of POS software include:

* **Recurring Payments**: Automate recurring donations or membership dues efficiently.
* **Inventory Management**: Digital tracking of product inventory if your nonprofit sells goods.
* **Employee Management**: Some systems can monitor employee clock-ins and clock-outs.
* **Detailed Reporting**: Analyze business trends with data such as average transaction values.
* **Customer Management**: Store customer information for marketing and analysis, and enable donors to create accounts to track their donation history.
    

Selecting a processor with robust capabilities can prevent the need for a future switch if your initial choice lacks essential features.

### Virtual Terminals

A virtual terminal allows for credit card payments through a computer, where customer card details are manually entered. This method is particularly useful for processing payments over the phone.

### Payment Gateways

For nonprofits that accept online donations, integrating a payment gateway into your website is crucial. This system allows donors to set up recurring contributions or make one-time donations seamlessly.

## Additional Tips & Considerations

### Donors and Processing Fees

Nonprofits often worry about credit card fees reducing their net donations. One solution is to offer donors the option to cover these fees.

This small additional amount can be a voluntary contribution from the donor, ensuring they are not obliged to pay extra.

### Data Portability

If you need to switch payment processors, maintaining access to your donor database is essential.

Ensure your current processor allows easy data export, so you do not lose valuable donor information.

### Expertise is Key

Given the unique needs of nonprofits, partnering with a processor experienced in this sector is beneficial. Look for a provider that can help streamline your fundraising and bookkeeping.

Additionally, prioritize security by selecting a processor with proven expertise in handling donation platforms securely.
