## What is Mobile Credit Card Processing?

In the past, mobile phones were primarily used for calls and texts.

Today, they have evolved into multifunctional devices capable of streaming videos, playing music, and even handling payments.

For business owners with mobile operations, it's crucial to have a system to process customer payments.

Your mobile phone (or sometimes your customers' phones) can facilitate this, working similarly to traditional in-store payment methods.

## The Need for Mobile Payment Processing Services

Mobile payment processing is essential for businesses that operate outside of a fixed location. Various mobile enterprises can benefit from on-the-go payment solutions, including:

* Food trucks
* Event planners
* Virtual assistants
* Social media influencers
* Mobile massage therapists
* Personal trainers
* Musicians
* Auto detailers and mobile mechanics
* Hair Stylists
* Photographers
    

This list is definitely short, but it illustrates the wide range of businesses that find mobile payment processing convenient for both owners and customers.

This capability ensures immediate payment capture, reducing the risk of payment delays when funds may become unavailable.

## Exploring Mobile Payment Options

Like in-store payment methods, there are several ways to process mobile payments. You can choose one or a combination of these options:

### Browser-Based Payments

Many consumers shop online via their phones or tablets. This involves entering payment information on a checkout page, often stored securely for future use through tokenization.

### In-App Mobile Payments

Similar to browser-based payments, these occur within a mobile app.

Stores with dedicated apps (such as Walmart and Target) often use this method, which offers enhanced security and convenience as customers register their payment methods once for ongoing use.

### Wireless Credit Card Readers

These devices allow credit card swiping on the go, transforming any mobile phone or tablet into a mini POS system through Bluetooth or a headphone jack connection.

Wireless credit card terminals, requiring only WiFi, are another option.

### Contactless Mobile Wallet Payments

Methods like Google Pay, Samsung Pay, and Apple Pay enable payments without swiping a card or entering numbers, utilizing NFC technology.

Customers simply wave their devices near a compatible reader to complete the transaction.

## Mobile Payment Processing vs. POS Systems

POS systems are standard hardware setups used in many businesses to process payments. They include components such as:

* A desktop unit or tablet
* A cash drawer
* A receipt printer
* A scanner
* A credit card machine
    

These systems are cloud-based, securely storing data online, and often feature additional capabilities like inventory management, sales reporting, payroll, customer loyalty programs, and promotional offers.

While mobile payment processing methods might not offer the full range of POS functionalities, they typically allow access to sales data and reports online.

Depending on the mobile processor, additional features may be available.

The primary distinction between mobile payment processing and traditional POS systems is mobility.

Some merchants use both to enjoy the flexibility of processing payments anywhere, enhancing customer service and operational efficiency.

## Consider These Factors Before Choosing a Mobile Credit Card Processing Company

The big question is: how do you choose the right mobile payment processor for your needs?

Here’s what you need to consider before making this decision.

### Do You Need a Combo Deal (POS and Mobile)?

First, decide how you plan to process your payments. If you’ll be selling both in-store and on the go, you’ll want to find a company that offers both solutions.

### Determine Which Features You Need

Mobile credit card processing services come with many features, but not all of them may be necessary for your business.

Standard features include:

* Tax settings
* Tipping options
* Receipts via email or text
* Split payments
* Recordings of cash or check payments
* Quick Sale options
    

Advanced features might include:

* Multiple tax rates
* Item categories
* Discount capabilities
* In-app invoicing
* Keyed-in entry
    

If you’re seeking advanced technology, you can find equipment that supports everything from cash drawers to SKU and barcode scanning. Your needs will dictate which features are essential.

### Transaction Fees

Every time you process a payment, whether by swipe, key-in, or mobile wallet, transaction fees apply.

These fees typically range from 1% to 4.99% for standard-risk merchants and can be higher for high-risk merchants.

Before committing to a mobile payment processor, ensure you understand their rates. You don’t want to pay more for the same services available at a lower cost elsewhere.

### Do You Want to Work with a Payment Aggregator or a Payment Processor?

There is a difference between the two.

Payment aggregators like PayPal and Stripe are popular among small businesses with low transaction volumes.

However, they have drawbacks. Frequent chargebacks or refund requests can lead to frozen accounts and held funds.

It’s not uncommon for these accounts to be closed without warning, potentially restricting access to your money for months.

Payment aggregators are easy to set up and can start accepting payments quickly, but they may not offer the same stability as dedicated payment processors.

Working with a payment processor can provide added protection. It’s less likely that your funds will be frozen or your account closed unexpectedly.

## Choosing the Best Mobile Payment Processor

With the basic information covered, it’s time to select your mobile payment processing company.

Ask these questions before signing up:

* What security and fraud protection do you offer?
* Is live support available online or by phone?
* What are your business hours? Can I contact someone at night?
* How quickly will deposits be made to my business bank account?
* What is your pricing structure? (Interchange-Plus is a transparent model.)
* Do you partner with other companies for services I receive?
* Do you offer sales reporting tools or other features?
* Are there additional fees?
* What happens if I stop using your services? Are there termination fees or contracts?
* Can the checkout process be customized for my customers?
    

## Additional Considerations

Before choosing your mobile payment processor, keep the following in mind:

### You’ll Need a Merchant Account

A merchant account is necessary for processing payments with a mobile processor or a POS system.

Your merchant account receives the money from customers, deducts transaction fees, and then sends the remaining funds to your business bank account.

Payment aggregators use a single merchant account for all users, which can lead to account closures and frozen funds without notice due to risk management.

A mobile payment processing company typically provides individual merchant accounts, reducing the risk of account issues.

### Separate Providers for Merchant Accounts and Payment Processing

Some merchant account providers also offer payment processing services, while others partner with different companies. Choose a setup that you’re comfortable with.

### Check the Company’s Track Record

Research the payment processing company thoroughly. Look for reviews, check the Better Business Bureau, and verify their reliability and longevity in the industry.

### Your Future Plans

Consider your business’s growth potential. If you plan to expand from a mobile operation to a storefront or online sales, choose a company that can scale with you.
