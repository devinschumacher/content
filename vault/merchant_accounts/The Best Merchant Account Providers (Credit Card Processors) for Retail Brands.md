## What is Retail Credit Card Processing?

To accept credit card payments, whether in person or online, your business will require a credit card processor.

A credit card processing company serves as the intermediary between your business and your customer's credit card company.

There are typically three stages of a transaction in which the credit card processor is involved:

1.  **Authorization**: The cardholder's details and transaction information are sent to the payment processor, which forwards the request to the appropriate card network. The card network then communicates with the issuing bank to authorize or decline the transaction.
2.  **Settlement**: Typically at the end of each business day, transactions are settled. The issuing bank charges the customer's card and transfers funds, minus interchange fees, to the payment processor.
3.  **Funding**: After settlements, the payment processor transfers the funds to the merchant's bank account, minus any processing fees.
    

Retail credit card processing enables retail merchants like yourself to accept various forms of payment, such as credit cards, debit cards, and more, beyond just cash.

This service processes all payments you receive, ensuring that the funds eventually reach your business bank account through proper channels.

In essence, once a payment is accepted, the money is routed to your merchant account.

Fees are deducted before the remaining amount is sent to your business bank account, making it accessible to you.

## Why Consider Retail Credit Card Processing?

Despite the dominance of cash, credit cards are steadily increasing their share of transactions annually. Businesses aim to offer their customers the convenience of credit card payments.

If you own a retail store, whether a physical location or an online shop, the ability to accept credit card payments is crucial. Without it, you risk losing customers to competitors who do.

Payment processors allow businesses to handle:

* Major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover)
* Debit cards
* eChecks
* Digital wallets and mobile payments (Google Pay, Apple Pay)
* Bank transfers/Automated Clearing House (ACH)
    

Additionally, payment processors can enhance your business with advanced technology tools. Modern systems provide numerous features to help manage and grow your business, such as tracking:

* Items sold
* Customer purchase data
* Payment methods used by customers
    

Selecting the right credit card processor enables you to accept non-credit card payments, including PIN-entered debit card payments and ACH.

## Considerations for Choosing a Retail Payment Processor

Depending on your store type and preferences, you may have a specific payment method in mind. However, understanding all available options is beneficial.

### Transaction Patterns

Every business is unique, and your transaction patterns should influence your choice of payment processor.

Do you handle a high volume of small transactions or a low volume of larger transactions?

A high volume of low-value transactions might make you more concerned about transaction fees.

In contrast, high-value but low-volume sales may classify your business as high risk, posing a greater challenge to the processor if a customer cancels or requests a refund.

Consider your customers' transaction habits. Are they primarily online or in person? Do you need a stationary card processing setup or mobile payment capabilities?

High in-person transaction volumes might necessitate a full point-of-sale (POS) system with robust software, while a simple card reader might suffice for lower volumes.

### Pricing Models

Payment processors use various pricing models, each with pros and cons.

#### Interchange-Plus

Displays interchange fees plus processing costs, involving a percentage and a small flat fee. However, detailed statements can be complex.

#### Flat Rate

Charges a flat percentage plus a fee per transaction. While simple, it may not take advantage of lower interchange fees for certain transactions.

#### Tiered Pricing

Categorizes payment methods into qualified, mid-qualified, and non-qualified categories, depending on criteria set by the processor.

This model can be less transparent and more challenging to understand.

#### Subscription

Similar to Interchange-Plus, but involves a monthly membership fee and a small per-transaction fee. The percentage fee is eliminated, which may be preferable depending on the membership rate.

Processors might offer volume discounts if your business qualifies. Review contracts carefully to understand expected charges and any cancellation fees for terminating services early.

### POS Systems and Credit Card Terminals

Many merchants prefer standard POS systems and credit card terminals due to familiarity. Modern systems offer enhanced functionality, such as:

* Inventory tracking and management
* Employee clock-in/out
* Payroll management
    

POS systems can range from basic to highly advanced, tailored to meet your needs. Choose a merchant services provider that customizes hardware for your business.

### Online Shopping Cart Integration

For eCommerce stores, shopping cart integration is essential. Retail credit card processing companies offer various shopping cart options:

* Checkout buttons for websites
* Hosted checkout pages
* White label checkout pages
    

Some companies can even build an integrated eCommerce website for you, ready for customer transactions.

### Virtual Terminals

Virtual terminals, web-based apps that allow payment processing via any internet-connected device, offer versatility for processing various payment types.

### Mobile Card Readers and Apps

If your retail business is mobile, mobile payment processing capabilities are crucial. Mobile card readers or app-based systems enable you to accept payments anywhere.

## Choosing the Best Retail Payment Processor

Ensure you get the best tools for the job at a reasonable price.

### Software with Benefits

Using a POS system can significantly enhance retail operations.

Advanced software eliminates manual inventory management and allows quick access to product availability and customer data. This reduces human errors and increases accuracy.

Advanced software also enables customer data analysis, informing business decisions and saving time compared to manual data management.

Some systems can store customer information like birthdays and emails for marketing purposes. Choose industry-specific software tailored to your needs.

### Hardware that Fits Your Business

Typical system configurations include:

* **Digital Register Screen**: Visual POS system interface displaying inventory and customer data.
* **Barcode Scanne**r: Handheld or stationary device for scanning product codes, updating inventory, and providing pricing information.
* **Receipt Printer**: Produces transaction receipts for customers, with details like cost, time, location, and contact information.
* **Cash Drawer**: Secure storage for cash and coins, opening upon transaction completion.
* **Card Reader**: Essential for credit card payments, with options ranging from magstripe readers to chip and tap-to-pay technologies.
    

### Integration

When upgrading or changing payment processors, ensure your data can be transferred seamlessly. Many systems integrate with existing software like QuickBooks or import data from other sources.

Consider system complexity and the time required for implementation.

Look for a processor that offers smooth integration with minimal downtime and user-friendly systems requiring minimal training. Some processors provide free training and ongoing support.

### Contracts

Review contracts carefully for obligations and hidden fees. Determine if there are termination fees or contract duration requirements. Some processors offer month-to-month or contract-free options.

Read through any contract thoroughly to identify any undisclosed fees.

## Additional Tips & Considerations

### Security

With credit card fraud increasing by [44% from 2019 to 2020](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/preventing-fraud/credit-card-fraud-what-to-do-if-you-are-a-victim/), it's crucial to select a company that is PCI compliant.

The Payment Card Industry Standards are frequently updated, and payment processors must adhere to these minimum [guidelines](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/?document=pci_dss).

Some companies exceed these standards, but these guidelines represent the baseline best practices. Inquire about the security measures your payment processor implements.

### Customer Service

Choosing a company that will partner with you to help your business thrive is essential. If problems arise, your processor should assist in troubleshooting issues.

Determine what type of support they offer. Is 24/7 live help available? There should be multiple ways to contact them, such as a chat feature, help form, or dedicated service email.

If your system malfunctions, they should resolve the issue promptly.

### Reputation

Selecting a company with a solid reputation is vital. Look for reviews from other merchants.

Remember, people are often more motivated to leave negative reviews, so positive reviews indicate the company is exceeding expectations.

You can also check the Better Business Bureau’s directory to see if the company is a member or has any complaints filed.

Even non-member companies often have profiles, which can provide insights into their business longevity. Be cautious about new companies if you're concerned they may go out of business.

## What’s the Difference Between a POS System and a Virtual Terminal?

POS systems and virtual terminals both facilitate payment acceptance, but they differ in hardware.

A POS system is static, typically involving a tablet connected to a cash register, printer, and other equipment. A virtual terminal can be accessed on any device with a WiFi or data connection.

## What Should be Included in Your Retail Payment System?

When considering features for your credit card processing hardware and software, several add-ons can benefit your business:

### Gift Card Program

Many retail stores offer gift cards, popular for customers unsure what to buy. A retail merchant services provider might offer white-label gift cards with your branding.

### Loyalty Card Program

Loyalty cards reward customers for their patronage, encouraging repeat business. You can design programs such as offering a 20% discount after ten purchases within a year.

### SNAP/EBT Payments

If you sell food, accepting SNAP/EBT payments might be beneficial. These payments use government-issued cards, similar to credit cards, but funds come from a government account.

Discuss this option with your merchant account provider.

### Mobile Wallet Payment Capabilities

Mobile wallets like Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay are increasingly popular, especially among younger customers.

These payments offer robust fraud protection and require only a tap on an NFC reader integrated into your POS system or credit card terminal.

## Things to Know Before Choosing a Retail Payment Processing Company

Consider offering a variety of payment options, including ACH, checks, electronic checks, and alternative credit cards like Diners Club.

Your payment processor might also help you develop a store credit card to boost customer loyalty. If you have a brick-and-mortar store, think about future expansion or online operations.

Before choosing a processor:

* **Read Reviews**: Find out what other merchants say about their experiences.
* **Ask Questions**: Clarify anything you don’t understand. A company willing to answer your questions shows they are interested in earning your business.
* **Ensure Top-Notch Customer Service**: It's advantageous to have a dedicated sales professional or tech expert for assistance. Confirm if 24/7 support is available.
    

### Contracts

Be cautious of lengthy contracts. You may face two contracts: one with your payment processor detailing services, fees, and PCI compliance, and another if you lease equipment.

Avoid long-term contracts (3-5 years) with early termination fees. Month-to-month contracts with no early termination fees are ideal.

If leasing equipment, know the total cost compared to buying it outright.

### Shopping Around for the Best Rates

Don't be misled by claims of uniform rates. Merchant account providers vary, offering interchange-plus pricing, tiered pricing, and flat-rate pricing.

Beware of lower-than-normal transaction fee promises. Some companies use surcharge and cash discount programs that transfer fees to your customers.

### Avoid Payment Aggregators

Companies like PayPal and Stripe might seem attractive due to ease of setup and minimal underwriting, but they pose risks.

Excessive chargebacks could result in account closure and frozen funds, which small businesses can’t afford. Opting for a merchant account provider can help avoid these issues.
