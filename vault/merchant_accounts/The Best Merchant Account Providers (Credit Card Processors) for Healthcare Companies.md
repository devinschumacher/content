## Understanding Healthcare Payment Processing

Healthcare payment processing encompasses the acceptance of credit cards, debit cards, ACH payments, and other payment methods, both in person, online, and over the phone.

### Medical Providers and Payment Processing Needs

Doctors, dentists, therapists, and veterinarians, among others, frequently require payment processing services.

Providers in this sector rely on both hardware and software solutions to facilitate these transactions.

### Unique Payment Structures in Healthcare

Unlike other industries, healthcare payments often come from insurance companies, government programs, and direct patient payments. There's a noticeable trend toward increased out-of-pocket expenses for patients.

A 2019 [government report](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10830.pdf) revealed that patients bore 11.3% of healthcare costs, amounting to $407 billion, which includes deductibles, copays, and coinsurance.

### Challenges in Payment Collection

Many patients don't pay upfront, making it difficult for healthcare providers to collect payments.

Collaboration between patients and providers to offer flexible payment options can help meet these financial obligations.

## Why Healthcare Providers Need Payment Processing Services

### Enhanced Security

Handling personal payment information involves risks of cyber-attacks, especially with sensitive patient data.

Choosing a PCI-compliant payment processor ensures adherence to safety standards, securing customer information. With the rise in cybercrimes, securing data is crucial.

### HIPAA Compliance

Healthcare providers face additional complexities with medical records. Protected Health Information (PHI), including birthdates and insurance details, needs extra safeguarding.

A payment processor offering a business associate agreement (BAA) ensures additional security layers and accountability.

### Convenience for Patients

Offering multiple payment options enhances patient convenience and the likelihood of bill payment.

Patients may prefer paying from home, on their schedule. Given the delayed nature of healthcare billing, online instant payments facilitate account reconciliation.

### Streamlined Billing

Some processors offer automated statement reminders, increasing revenue by reducing staff time spent on payment collection.

Allowing patients to review their accounts themselves can reduce call volumes and improve cash flow.

## Essential Security Measures for Healthcare Payment Processors

Healthcare providers should ensure robust security measures, including:

* Encryption Technology: P2PE or point-to-point encryption secures data from the transaction point to the provider's system.
* Tokenization: Converts credit card data into encrypted tokens, protecting it even if breached.
* Secure Receipts: Using secure methods for sending receipts, rather than unsecured emails or texts.
* Chip Card Readers: Upgrading to EMV technology can [reduce fraud](https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2019/05/28/chip-technology-helps-1559068467332.html) significantly.
    

Discuss these security measures with your payment processor to ensure comprehensive protection.

## Setting Up a Healthcare Payment Processing Account

### Choosing the Right Hardware

Healthcare providers should stay updated on popular payment methods.

Consider options like mobile readers for on-the-go payments or contactless payments for digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay.

### Value-Added Software Services

* Integration: Look for processors that integrate with practice management software to update patient accounts automatically.
* Minimize Administrative Tasks: Automate statement sending and reminder functions to reduce staff workload.
* Recurring Payments: Securely store credit card information and schedule payments for increased cash flow.
    

### Clear Rates and Fees

Transparency in fees is crucial. Compare per transaction fees, monthly service fees, and equipment fees.

Understand both the processor's charges and the non-negotiable fees set by credit card companies.

### Contracts and Agreement Terms

Familiarize yourself with contract terms and potential cancellation fees. Month-to-month or no-contract options can offer flexibility.

## Additional Tips & Considerations

### Customer Service

Prioritize providers offering live customer support during your business hours. Ensure various support options like email, chat, or telephone are available.

### Ease of Implementation and Onboarding

Choose processors that assist with system training and have a manageable learning curve. Understanding basic functions early on is essential for smooth operations.

### Reputation

Select a processor with a solid reputation. Research reviews and Better Business Bureau ratings. Ensure they have experience working with healthcare providers.

## The Big Picture

Processing payments for healthcare is an important part of modern medical facilities.

Customers will find it convenient if you accept credit cards both online and in person. It can also help your business keep track of and collect on past due invoices.

When comparing payment processors, these are some important things to keep in mind:

* Different levels of data protection and knowledge of PCI/HIPAA rules
* How much it costs to work with the payment processor and what their contract says
* You can add features that will help your business, such as customer accounts and recurring billing.
    

It can be bad for your business and make your books more difficult to keep track of if you switch payment processors, so think about the pros and cons of each one carefully.

It's likely that you will use the service every day for your business, so picking a processor that works with yours will pay off.
