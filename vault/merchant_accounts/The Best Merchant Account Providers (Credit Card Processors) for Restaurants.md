## What is Restaurant Credit Card Processing?

Restaurant transactions can range widely from small to large based on the menu and services provided.

While some establishments might choose to operate on a cash-only basis, this approach can deter customers and potentially limit spending.

Credit cards are the preferred payment method for many, making it beneficial for restaurants to offer this option.

Partnering with a payment processor allows restaurants to accept:

* All major credit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover
* Online payments
* Mobile payments
* Contactless payments
* Digital wallet payments such as Google Pay or Apple Pay
    

## Factors to Consider Before Choosing a Restaurant Payment Processor

Typically, restaurant businesses aren't classified as high risk, giving them a broad range of payment processors to choose from. However, this abundance of options can be overwhelming. By understanding what to look for and the right questions to ask, you can find a processor that fits your needs.

### Pricing Models

Payment processors generally use one of three popular pricing models, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

#### Interchange-Plus Pricing

Interchange fees are set by card networks and are non-negotiable. In this model, the processor adds a percentage to each transaction plus a flat fee.

This model is favored for its transparency, providing a detailed cost breakdown for each transaction. However, the complexity of the details can be overwhelming.

#### Flat Rate Pricing

As implied by the name, this model applies a flat rate to every transaction along with a nominal fee, usually less than a dollar.

The main benefit is its simplicity and predictability. The downside is that you might miss out on savings from transactions that would qualify for lower interchange rates.

#### Tiered Pricing

This model categorizes transactions as qualified, mid-qualified, or non-qualified, with rates varying accordingly. These categories are based on factors like how the card was processed.

While this model can offer cost savings and straightforward statements, it obscures the true cost of processing since interchange fees and processor fees aren't distinguished.

Other models exist, but these are the most common. Ensure you discuss all fees and costs with your processor to understand their pricing structure and how you'll be charged.

### Types of Contracts

When engaging with a payment processor, carefully read the contract details. Some processors require contracts for a set term, with early termination fees if you end the contract prematurely.

Many processors now offer month-to-month agreements, providing more flexibility and peace of mind.

### Types of Hardware

Payment processing hardware has evolved significantly. Understanding the features your business might need now or in the future can influence your choice of processor.

Some popular hardware options include:

* **Cash Register**: Secure registers with digital interfaces that integrate with a Point of Sale (POS) system.
* **Customer Kiosks**: Standalone units for customers to place orders or process payments independently.
* **Barcode Reader**: Essential for managing inventory and pricing of pre-packaged items digitally.
* **Contactless and Digital Payment Points**: Advanced card readers that accept payments without swiping or inserting cards.
* **Kitchen Display System**: Sends orders directly to the kitchen in real-time, reducing human error.
    

Each processor offers different hardware options, so explore what's available to find the best fit for your restaurant.

## Value-Added Features to Look For

Beyond merely enabling payment transactions, payment processors often provide additional features through their software that can significantly benefit your business.

These features are frequently tailored to the restaurant industry, making it worthwhile to compare the offerings of several processors.

### Online Menus and Ordering

What was once considered optional has now become essential due to the pandemic's impact.

With the increasing preference for takeout or delivery, having a system that can handle online orders and payments is crucial for boosting your business's revenue options.

Notably, major chains like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ have adapted by closing their dining rooms at times and offering only takeout options.

This strategy allows businesses to remain operational and profitable even when they cannot fully staff their dining rooms.

Consider whether your restaurant needs to accept online orders now or if you might want to add this capability in the future.

### Customer Analytics

The software that powers your payment processing can also provide robust data analytics to inform your business decisions. By tracking orders digitally, you can identify your most popular items.

Your system’s reporting capabilities might also help you identify patterns in customer behavior, such as peak times during the day or year.

With this information, you can adjust staffing schedules and forecast supply orders more accurately. You can even use this data to inform marketing efforts like targeted emails or paid advertisements.

Monitoring your data can reveal trends over time, such as changes in average transaction value, even if overall sales remain steady. These features are powerful tools for making informed business decisions.

### Customer Loyalty Programs and Gift Cards

Many restaurant-friendly systems offer the ability to capture customer data, such as names, emails, and birthdays. This capability allows you to reach out to past customers with offers to encourage repeat business.

You could also create a loyalty program managed by your software to incentivize frequent visits, thereby increasing revenue.

Managing loyalty programs manually or with punch cards can be tedious and unreliable. Using a payment processor’s software streamlines this process without additional effort.

Similarly, digitalizing gift card issuance and redemption saves time for you and your staff and boosts sales as customers can buy gift cards for others.

### Staff Management

Many systems also offer features for tracking staff schedules and actual hours worked, enabling you to review work history or identify absence patterns.

This functionality helps alleviate the stress of scheduling by providing a clear view of your staffing needs.

## Additional Tips and Concerns

### Integration Capabilities

If your business already uses a specific restaurant management system and you just need to add payment processing, many processors can integrate with existing POS systems.

Choosing not to integrate may mean missing out on the data management benefits described above.

If you are not tied to an existing system, consider how easily you can export and take your data if you need to switch systems or processors later.

Many systems can quickly convert your data into portable files, making it easy to set up a new system without losing valuable information.

### Test Before You Buy

Many payment processors offer demos of their software or hardware. Seeing the software in action can reveal flaws or shortcomings that might not be obvious from descriptions alone.

Some payment processors provide these demos directly on their websites.

### Training and Customer Service

Before committing to a payment processor, understand the setup and training required.

Restaurants typically operate in a fast-paced environment with little downtime, so look for a company that offers quick setup and minimal training.

Some processors offer online training to facilitate system implementation.

Customer service is also crucial. Even after setup, you need reliable support if something goes wrong.

Many processors offer various support channels, including phone, email, and live chat. Ensure your processor provides assistance when you need it, especially during peak business hours.

Some companies offer 24/7 live support, which might be necessary depending on your restaurant’s needs.

## Savor the Savings With the Best Credit Card Processing Solutions

Restaurants that take credit cards may be able to compete better with those that don't. If you own a restaurant, you should think about which pricing models, contracts, and system hardware will work best for your business.

In addition to processing payments, you should think about what other services the processor can offer, such as analytical tools and staff management tools.

If you can, test drive the systems and make sure they will work with the way you already have things set up. Pick a processor that will help your business both when it first starts up and in the future.

Spend some time comparing what's available and then make a choice. A good payment processor can help you build a business relationship that lasts.
