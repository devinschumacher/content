## What is Gun-Friendly Credit Card Processing?

For any business aiming to be profitable, accepting credit card payments is essential.

However, not all merchant services providers are willing to work with every type of business. A gun-friendly payment processing company is one that will accommodate firearms retailers.

## Why Are Firearm Retailers Considered High-Risk?

The firearms industry is deemed high-risk, which means merchant account providers and payment processors are often hesitant to work with them.

Those who do typically charge higher fees to offset the associated risks.

## Why Do Firearm Retailers Need to Process Payments?

Firearms are high-ticket items, making credit card, debit card, and other payment processing crucial for sales, whether online or in-store.

Most customers do not carry large sums of cash, so without alternative payment methods, gun merchants cannot thrive.

## Requirements for Accepting Credit Card Payments as a Gun Merchant

Accepting and processing credit card payments involves a detailed process with three main components:

### Merchant Account

Establishing a merchant account is essential for your firearms business. This account temporarily holds your sales revenue while it awaits further processing.

After funds arrive, transaction, monthly, and yearly fees are deducted. High-risk merchants may also face rolling reserves, where a percentage of sales is held in a separate account for about six months.

These funds are released over time, helping protect against chargebacks and covering costs. Remaining funds are then transferred to your business bank account.

### Payment Processor

Many merchant account providers also offer payment processing services, or they can refer you to a partner.

The payment processor manages the flow of money from each transaction until it reaches your business bank account, handling most tasks behind the scenes.

### Business Bank Account

Your business bank account, which you likely already have, is where your sales revenue ends up after fees and rolling reserves are deducted.

From this account, you can withdraw funds, pay employees, and cover other business expenses.

## Can Firearms Dealers Use Payment Aggregators?

In short, no. Here’s why:

The major payment aggregators explicitly prohibit firearms merchants in their terms of service:

* PayPal: Disallows transactions involving ammo, firearms, or related parts and accessories.
* Square: Prohibits goods such as firearms, firearm hardware and parts, ammunition, and weapons.
* Stripe: Forbids payment processing for regulated or age-restricted goods, including weapons and munitions.
    

Despite the allure of quick payment processing setup times, using these services can be problematic.

Some high-risk merchants circumvent these terms by not fully disclosing their business activities, which can lead to significant issues.

Misrepresenting your business can result in being listed on the MATCH list, making it extremely difficult to secure payment processing services in the future.

## What to Consider Before Selecting a Gun Merchant Credit Card Processor

With a grasp on how merchant services for gun retailers operate, it's crucial to focus on finding the right provider to suit your needs.

### Decide on Your Sales Channels

In the U.S., firearm businesses can function online, in a physical storefront, or both. Determining your business model is essential as it dictates the hardware and software requirements.

For a brick-and-mortar setup, consider POS systems, credit card terminals, or virtual terminals. If your sales will primarily be online, you'll need shopping cart integration with a payment gateway.

Ensure that the merchant services provider you choose can accommodate these needs.

### Recognize Your High-Risk Status

As a gun merchant, you're classified as high-risk. This designation comes with higher payment processing costs compared to standard-risk businesses like restaurants or grocery stores.

Be prepared for:

* Rolling reserves
* Long-term contracts
* Higher transaction fees
* Potentially high early termination fees
    

Choosing the right company and building a solid processing history can help ease these requirements over time.

Some companies specialize in working with high-risk businesses to reduce processing costs, so explore all available options.

### Accepting Alternative Payment Methods

Payment methods have evolved significantly. Today, options include:

* Mobile wallets
* EMV chip cards
* Gift cards
* ACH
* Electronic checks
    

These methods are increasingly popular for their convenience. Decide which payment types you want to accept, both in-store and online, to stay competitive in your industry.

## Selecting the Best Gun-Friendly Merchant Account Provider

When it's time to choose a merchant account provider, consider the following tips:

### Carefully Review Your Contract

As a high-risk merchant, you’ll likely have a long-term contract. Scrutinize it for:

* Early termination fees
* Rolling reserve requirements
* Monthly or annual fees
* Chargeback fees
* Miscellaneous fees (like account statement fees)
    

Be vigilant about hidden fees and ensure the provider is transparent about costs. Ask about hardware costs, which might involve a separate contract.

Some providers offer free POS systems and credit card terminals, while others lease them, often at high costs. Check if the company can work with any existing equipment you have.

### Inquire About Chargeback Protection and Prevention

High-risk merchants often face numerous chargebacks, which are disputes initiated by customers over transactions. This can happen due to perceived fraud or customers reversing charges through their banks.

Ensure your processor offers chargeback protection and prevention services, such as alerts when a chargeback is filed. This allows you to address the issue with the customer before it escalates.

### Look for Load Balancing Options

High-risk merchants should consider processors offering load balancing, which involves multiple merchant accounts.

This spreads the impact of chargebacks across several accounts, minimizing risk. If funds are frozen in one account, you'll still have access to money in others.

## Additional Tips to Get Started

Before you start exploring gun-friendly credit card processors, keep these final tips in mind:

### Have Your Documentation Ready

Prepare all required documents before applying, such as:

* Three months of personal and business bank statements
* Three months of processing statements (if available)
* A voided check or bank letter
* Your driver’s license
* Your business license
* Your business plan
    

Submitting everything promptly can expedite the approval process, typically within a week.

### Be Honest About Your Processing Volume

Accurately assess your monthly processing volume and future projections. Honesty helps avoid caps that could prevent you from accepting payments later. Work with your processor to find suitable limits.

### Keep Future Needs in Mind

Consider your long-term business plans. For example, if you plan to expand online in a year, ensure your provider supports both online and physical sales.

Avoid long-term contracts that don't align with your future goals.

By thoroughly evaluating these factors, you'll be better positioned to choose a merchant services provider that aligns with your business needs.
