## Understanding Bad Credit Merchant Services Providers

A merchant services provider is a business that facilitates credit card and other payment processing for companies.

When it comes to bad credit merchant services providers, these are specialized entities that cater specifically to businesses with less-than-ideal credit histories.

Contrary to what many business owners might believe, it is entirely possible to find a merchant account provider even if your credit isn't perfect.

Numerous companies are equipped to assist businesses facing credit challenges.

## What Services do Merchant Account Providers Offer?

Merchant account providers primarily offer services that enable businesses to process payments for their products and services.

Essentially, a merchant account acts as a holding tank for the money earned from sales.

Upon approval of a sale, funds are transferred from the customer's account to the merchant account, where any applicable fees are deducted before the remaining amount is sent to the business's bank account.

Many providers also offer payment processing services, allowing business owners to manage all their payment needs in one place, which can be very convenient.

### Beyond Basic Services: Additional Offerings

Merchant services providers often extend beyond basic payment processing, offering additional services such as:

* Loyalty and gift card programs
* ATM placement and maintenance
* Business funding (working capital)
* Payroll and bookkeeping services
* Inventory tracking and management
    

## Who Benefits from Bad Credit Payment Processing Services?

Various factors can necessitate the need for a merchant services provider that caters to businesses with bad credit.

Business owners with low credit scores will find that many providers consider their personal credit history when assessing risk.

### Bankruptcy History

If you or your business have filed for bankruptcy, you will likely fall into the bad credit category.

Fortunately, bankruptcy does not stay on your credit report foreverâ€”Chapter 13 lasts seven years, while Chapter 7 remains for ten years.

### Low Personal Credit Scores

It's important to be aware of your FICO credit score. Scores of 580 or below may classify you as a credit risk.

Established businesses with a payment processing history may fare better, but new businesses with low FICO scores may encounter difficulties.

### Outstanding Judgments or Liens

Judgments from criminal or civil courts, or liens, can significantly impact your credit. However, if you're making timely payments on a lien, there's more leniency compared to unpaid taxes.

## Should Bad Credit Merchants Opt for Payment Aggregators?

Some merchants with bad credit opt to use payment aggregators like Stripe, PayPal, or Square instead of traditional payment processors.

While these aggregators provide necessary payment processing services, they share a single master merchant account among multiple businesses.

This can be risky if one business accumulates too many chargebacks, potentially freezing the funds of all merchants under the account.

It's generally safer to work with a merchant services provider that offers dedicated accounts and individualized payment processing services.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Bad Credit Merchant Account Provider

When selecting a merchant account provider for bad credit, keep the following in mind:

### High-Risk Classification

As a business with bad credit, you'll be considered high-risk.

While this label means higher rates and fees initially, improving your processing history can lead to better contract terms or opportunities to find providers with more favorable rates.

### Contract Awareness

Expect to sign long-term contracts due to your high-risk status.

Ensure all fees and terms are clearly explained before signing, and be cautious with contracts for payment processing equipment to avoid excessive costs.

### Rolling Reserves

High-risk merchants may face rolling reserves, where a portion of sales is set aside monthly as a cushion against chargebacks.

These funds are held for six months before being released back to the merchant, a process that continues until reserves are no longer needed.

## Securing a Merchant Account with Bad Credit

Though obtaining a merchant account with bad credit involves more steps, it is achievable.

Follow these tips to get started:

1.  Research MSPs specializing in bad credit merchants and ensure they meet your needs.
2.  Compare quotes from your top choices to find the best deal.
3.  Negotiate for favorable terms, such as lower processing rates or waived fees.
4.  Submit your application and all required documentation.
5.  Once approved, thoroughly review the contract and ask questions about unclear terms.
    

With patience and diligence, you can secure a merchant account even with bad credit, enabling your business to process payments efficiently.

## What to Expect with Bad Credit Credit Card Processing

Facing the challenge of being labeled high-risk in credit card processing? Brace yourself for increased costs and a few more hurdles along the way.

Here's a detailed look at what to expect.

### Elevated Fees

As a high-risk merchant, you'll likely encounter higher fees when setting up your merchant account and securing payment processing services, at least initially.

Monthly and annual fees from merchant service providers are common, and you might also face application or approval fees.

Be vigilant about hidden feesâ€”always inquire about these before signing any contracts.

### Increased Processing Rates

Expect transaction fees to be nearly double compared to standard-risk merchants.

While some providers offer tiered pricing, opting for interchange-plus pricing can be more transparent and often more economical.

### Caps on Monthly Processing Volume

High-risk merchant accounts often come with a cap on how much you can process monthly. Exceeding this limit might result in frozen funds until the end of your billing cycle.

To avoid this, be upfront about your expected processing volume each month.

Transparency is crucial in the credit card processing industry, and being honest with your merchant service provider can lead to better cooperation and solutions.

### Beneficial Programs: Extra Support for High-Risk Merchants

Top high-risk merchant account providers recognize the challenges you face and often offer additional services to help you, such as:

* Chargeback Protection: Assists in managing excessive chargebacks.
* Chargeback Prevention: Helps identify and mitigate potential chargebacks before they occur.
* Fraud Protection: Detects potential fraud cases that could lead to chargebacks.
