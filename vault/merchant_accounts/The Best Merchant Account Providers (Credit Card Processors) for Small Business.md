## How to Choose the Most Suitable Credit Card Processor for Your Small Business

Selecting the right credit card processor is crucial for the success of your small business. With numerous options available, each offering different features, fees, and benefits, the decision can be overwhelming.

Finding the most suitable processor ensures smooth transactions, cost savings, and satisfied customers. First things first, let's talk about the basics.

### What are Small Business Merchant Accounts?

Whether you're starting a new small business or have been running one for years, having a merchant account is essential for processing payments.

A merchant account not only facilitates the handling of payments for your business but also provides a designated place for those funds to be deposited, which is crucial.

Once the money reaches your merchant account, it can be transferred to your business bank account, giving you access to it.

Although small businesses have alternatives to merchant accounts, they are not as preferable. Keep reading to understand why merchant accounts are the better option.

### Roles of Merchant Account Providers

Simply put, merchant account providers offer merchant accounts.

These accounts enable merchants, like yourself, to process payments, directing the money into your merchant account, and eventually, into your business bank account. It's a straightforward process.

### Why Small Businesses Should Have Merchant Accounts

As a small business owner, it's beneficial to accept as many payment forms as possible.

Common payment methods include:

* Credit cards (EMV chip and Magstripe)
* Debit cards
* Checks and electronic checks
* ACH
* EBT
* Digital wallets (Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.)
    

While there are more options, these are the most preferred. Limiting yourself to only accepting cash could result in lost business opportunities.

A suitable merchant account allows you to accept payments in a physical store and online.

### Merchant Accounts vs. Payment Aggregators: What’s the Difference?

Now that you understand merchant accounts, let's discuss an alternative: payment aggregators. Companies like PayPal or Stripe, which you may know, act as payment aggregators.

They process payments under one "master" merchant account. While they offer benefits such as no waiting for underwriter approval, minimal paperwork, flat fees, and no startup costs, there are significant drawbacks.

#### Cons of Payment Aggregators

* Money transfers to your business bank account can be delayed.
* Fraud suspicions can result in holds on your funds.
* Fraud alerts can lead to account closures, affecting your ability to process payments.
* Growing businesses may face increased fees.
* Transaction limits can stunt business growth.
* Loss of valuable shopping cart data to the payment aggregator.
* Limited control over the checkout process, potentially resulting in lost sales.
    

A reliable merchant account provider eliminates these concerns.

### Benefits of Small Business Merchant Accounts

* **Underwriting**: Merchant account providers assess the risk when approving applications because banks need to ensure they can recover funds in case of refunds.
* **Accept Payments in Multiple Currencies**: Ideal for businesses with global aspirations.
* **Increased Sales**: Customers tend to spend more when they can pay with credit cards.
* **Avoiding Bad Checks**: With the right provider, checks can be instantly converted to electronic checks, identifying bad checks immediately.
* **Happy Customers**: Offering multiple payment options keeps customers satisfied and caters to the diverse ways people manage their money, such as through mobile wallets.
    

Having a merchant account provides small businesses with numerous advantages, from smoother transactions to increased sales and customer satisfaction.

### What Types of Fees Come With Opening a Merchant Account?

When opening a merchant account, it's essential to be aware of the various fees involved.

Every provider has different charges, but here’s a general overview of what you might encounter:

* Application or Account Setup Fees
* Monthly or Annual Account Fees
* Monthly Minimum Fees (if you don’t process enough transactions)
* PCI Compliance Fees
* Statement Fees
* Early Termination Fees
* Chargeback Fees
    

### Which Businesses Require Small Business Merchant Accounts?

* Catering services and restaurants
* Website design companies
* Business consulting firms
* Bookkeepers and tax preparation services
* Couriers
* Barber Shops and hairdressers
* Cleaning services
* Gyms and personal trainers

### Selecting the Right Merchant Services for Your Small Business

You’ll have numerous options for merchant account providers. Here’s a checklist to help you choose the best one:

#### Ensure They Offer the Hardware/Software You Need

If you require a POS system, don’t let them push a payment gateway if it doesn’t suit your needs. They should prioritize your requirements.

#### Look for Useful Add-ons

Consider features that can help manage your business, like inventory or employee schedule management software. If it sounds beneficial, it likely is.

#### Demand Transparency in Pricing and Fees

The payment processing industry can be confusing, so don’t hesitate to ask for clear explanations. Providers should be upfront about all fees (see the list above for what to expect).

#### Understand the Processing Rates and Pricing Model

Pro Tip - Interchange Plus is noted for its transparency.

#### Avoid Misleading Sales Tactics

Be wary of claims like “Transaction fees as low as 0%!” without clear details on actual fees.

#### Prefer Flexible Contracts

Look for month-to-month agreements or contracts with minimal early termination fees.

#### Excellent Customer Support is Crucial

Ensure the provider offers reliable customer service for any issues that might arise.

### Opening a Small Business Merchant Account

With the basics covered, here’s how to open your small business merchant account.

#### The Application Process

Many companies have streamlined their application process, ranging from quick online forms to over-the-phone applications. After applying, you’ll need to provide various documents, such as:

* Your business EIN number
* Details about your products or services
* Personal information (name, address, social security number, etc.)
* Your business plan
* References, if requested
* Bank statements showing your payment processing history (if available)
    

#### Submitting Your Application

Once you have all the required documents, you can submit your application. Here are some tips:

##### Tip #1: Ensure Completeness

Double-check all information before submitting. Adding additional information, like personal investments in your business, can be beneficial.

##### Tip #2: Be Honest About Potential Issues

If you have poor credit or past bankruptcies, disclose these upfront to demonstrate honesty.

##### Tip #3: Provide All Requested Information

Even if a request seems odd, provide the information. There’s usually a reason behind it.

##### Tip #4: Set Realistic Sales Volume Expectations

Be upfront about your expected monthly sales volume and any upcoming product launches. Update the provider if circumstances change.

#### Awaiting Approval

After submitting, the waiting begins. Many providers can approve accounts within 72 hours or faster for low-risk applicants.

Feel free to ask about the approval timeframe, and stay busy until you receive confirmation.
