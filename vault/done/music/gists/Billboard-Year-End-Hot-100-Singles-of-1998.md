"Bitter Sweet Symphony" by The Verve is a powerful and ambitious Britpop anthem released in June 1997. It boasts a six-minute-long, lyrically opaque arrangement inspired by The Rolling Stones' 1965 hit, "The Last Time. " The song became incredibly popular, despite the controversial business issues surrounding its production.

Richard Ashcroft of The Verve finally regained full credits and publishing rights for the song in 2019 after multiple court cases and negotiations. "Bitter Sweet Symphony" stands as a significant piece of late 90s Britpop history and continues to resonate among music enthusiasts.
