## Buyers Guide: High Risk Merchant Accounts

### Understanding High Risk

Let's start by clarifying what "high risk" means. While the term might seem alarming, it doesn't necessarily indicate something negative. Various factors contribute to a business being labeled as high risk, and most aren't as problematic as the term suggests.

Credit card companies, such as VISA and MasterCard, prioritize protecting their cardholders.

They provide services like disputing fraudulent transactions, processing chargebacks, and offering peace of mind, encouraging customers to use their credit cards freely, sometimes spending more than they have.

But what happens when a customer is dissatisfied with a purchase and requests a chargeback? The merchant, in this case, you, the business owner, must cover the cost. If the business can't pay, the merchant services provider (MSP) bears the financial burden, highlighting the "risk" involved for MSPs.

Certain industries statistically present more risk, such as firearms, bail bonds, and marijuana. Online businesses, where transactions occur without verifying the cardholder's identity, are also more prone to fraud.

Additionally, businesses with models prone to chargebacks, like those that auto-enroll customers in monthly payments or offer subjective-quality services, are seen as high risk.

A high-risk designation doesn't imply wrongdoing; it simply means the business has a higher likelihood of chargebacks and fraud, making it riskier for merchant account providers to extend credit processing services.

### What is a High-Risk Merchant Account?

A high-risk merchant account is designed for businesses with financial unpredictability, high dispute/chargeback rates, and elevated potential loss risks for the MSP and bank providing payment processing infrastructure.

Securing a high-risk merchant account involves partnering with a company that equips your business to accept credit card payments, both in-person and online.

It's crucial to establish a strong relationship with your MSP, ensuring they understand your business and work closely with you.

### The Merchant Account Provider’s Role

When an MSP partners with a business, it fulfills several key roles:

* Payment Processing: Providing the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure for accepting credit card payments.
* Intermediary Services: Managing interactions with card companies (like VISA and MasterCard) and banks, handling the complex aspects of credit card transactions, such as authorization and settlement.
* Financial Guarantor: Acting as the business’s financial backer. In cases of fraud, excessive chargebacks, or refunds, the MSP covers the losses.
    

MSPs charge fees for these services, with higher fees for high-risk businesses. This is akin to car insurance, where a history of accidents and an expensive car lead to higher premiums.

So, why choose a High-Risk Merchant Account?

Despite higher costs, a high-risk merchant account provides essential tools for accepting credit card payments, ensuring your business can operate smoothly and securely.

### Why Opt for a High-Risk Merchant Account?

As a business owner, you might wonder, "Why should I choose a high-risk merchant account when the fees are higher?" It's a fair question, and the answer lies in how essential it is for your business to accept payments beyond cash or checks.

High-risk merchant accounts not only protect the merchant account provider but also safeguard your business from various risks.

Many business owners either lack awareness of the distinction between high-risk and low-risk accounts or simply opt for a payment service provider (PSP) with low fees and quick setup, like PayPal.

Initially, setting up an account with such PSPs seems straightforward—enter some details and you're done. However, issues arise when their system flags an aspect of your business operations, such as:

* Excessive chargebacks
* Fraud incidents
* Unusually high transaction volumes
* Website security breaches
* Policy changes by the PSP
* Industry-related scrutiny or fraud at a competitor
    

These issues can lead to your account being frozen or closed, leaving you unable to accept credit card payments for days or even weeks. Your only recourse might be dealing with unhelpful customer support, which can be frustrating.

Choosing a high-risk merchant account provider ensures that they anticipate and prepare for such scenarios before your account is created. This preparation is crucial for maintaining your business operations seamlessly.

### Benefits of High-Risk Merchant Accounts

* Underwriting
* Global Expansion Capabilities
* No Volume Caps
* Minimized Chargeback Issues
* Streamlined Payment Flow
    

A common mistake is thinking that using services like PayPal, Stripe, or Square means you have a merchant account. These companies are merchant account aggregators, meaning they don’t tailor their services to your specific business needs.

They can quickly shut down your account if they detect any suspicious activity, leaving you stranded.

A high-risk merchant account provider, on the other hand, conducts thorough underwriting to understand your business.

This due diligence means they are less likely to freeze or close your account when unexpected events occur, providing peace of mind and operational continuity.

### High-Risk Classification Factors

Several factors can classify a business as high-risk, including:

* Poor or no credit history
* No experience with credit card processing
* Past incidents of fraud or illegal activity
* International sales
* Selling products with reputational risks (e.g., adult products, smoking accessories)
* Operating in highly regulated industries (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, firearms)
* Mail-order, telephone-order, or online transactions (card-not-present situations)
* High average transaction amounts
* History of high chargebacks
    

Many industries and business models are considered high-risk by default.

If your business falls into one of these categories, you might need a high-risk merchant account to ensure smooth payment processing and business continuity.

* Accounting & Tax Prep
* Adult Entertainment
* Alcohol
* Antiques & Collectibles
* Bad Credit, Credit Repair

There are some MSPs that specialize in these niches under the high-risk umbrella. If any of these describe your business, please look at the high risk merchant account providers we've listed below. You can also read our review articles that go into more detail about high risk providers in each industry or category.

## Key Considerations for Selecting a High-Risk Merchant Account Provider

Securing a high-risk merchant account involves careful consideration from both the business and the merchant service provider (MSP).

While MSPs evaluate businesses for potential risk, business owners must also be discerning when choosing a provider to avoid unnecessary fees, account closures, or being placed on the Terminated Merchant File (TMF) list.

### What to Consider When Choosing an MSP

#### Expertise and Track Record

Assess the MSP's experience with high-risk accounts, particularly in your industry and business type.

Check their longevity in the market and look for case studies or testimonials that illustrate their ability to handle challenges specific to your sector.

#### Features and Solutions

Determine the range of features and solutions the MSP offers beyond the basic merchant account.

Look for additional services like payment gateways, fraud screening, transaction routing, decline salvage, and comprehensive reporting.

#### Previous Processing History

Evaluate your business's history with processing credit card transactions. Be prepared to provide data on high-risk indicators such as chargeback ratios and monthly revenue volatility.

#### Flexibility and Customization

Ensure the MSP can tailor their services to meet your specific business needs. Customization can be crucial for effectively managing the unique risks associated with high-risk merchant accounts.

#### Rolling Reserves

Understand the cash requirements for rolling reserves needed to keep your account solvent. This can significantly impact your cash flow management.

### Preparing for a High-Risk Merchant Account

To improve your chances of approval, present your business as credible and well-prepared. Here's how to navigate the application process and enhance your likelihood of success:

#### Application Process

Treat the application process as an opportunity to clearly and accurately portray your business to the underwriter.

Whether you handle this yourself or seek professional assistance, the goal is to present your business as low-risk and well-organized.

#### Interaction with Underwriters

Underwriters often look for reasons to decline applications.

If you're not working with someone experienced in dealing with underwriting departments, be cautious and deliberate in your interactions to avoid raising red flags.

### Tips for Application Preparation

#### Demonstrate Commitment

Show that you have a tangible stake in your business. This could be through a physical location, personal investment, or local community ties, demonstrating your commitment and reducing perceived risk.

#### Maintain Control

Avoid relying too heavily on outsourced services. Having control over key business operations reassures underwriters of your stability and reliability.

#### Avoid Tricky Marketing Tactics

Stay away from misleading marketing practices like negative options or forced continuity. These can lead to higher chargeback rates and distrust from both customers and underwriters.

#### Address Any Black Marks

If your business has faced bankruptcies, poor credit, judgments, or high chargeback rates, provide clear explanations upfront.

Transparency helps underwriters make informed decisions and avoids negative assumptions.

#### Be Cooperative

Always provide requested information without questioning the underwriter’s motives. This cooperation builds trust and increases your chances of approval.

#### Set Realistic Volume Expectations

List conservative monthly volume estimates on your application. Drastic increases without historical data can raise concerns.

It's better to start with manageable figures and gradually request increases as your business grows.

By carefully selecting an MSP and thoroughly preparing your application, you can successfully navigate the challenges of obtaining a high-risk merchant account and ensure a smoother onboarding process.
