## **Buyer's Guide for High-Risk Merchant Accounts**

### **Unlocking the Mystery Behind the Term "High Risk"**

First, let's investigate the meaning of the term "high risk."

However, despite the fact that the term could at first appear to be concerning, it is crucial to avoid being excessively concerned by the description "high risk." When a company falls into this category, it is due to a number of different issues, the most of which are not as serious as the word suggests they are.

VISA and MasterCard are two examples of credit card businesses that place a high priority on protecting their consumers, often known as cardholders, for obvious financial reasons. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary to provide customers with the capacity to contest fraudulent transactions, to carry out chargebacks for purchases that were not desirable, and to guarantee that cardholders feel safe when using their credit cards.

Despite its seeming lack of significance, the plastic card gives users the ability to spend more than they are currently able to afford. However, where does the element of risk come into play?

Take, for example, a customer who is unhappy with their purchase and decides to file a chargeback. The responsibility of covering the expense is placed on the proprietor of the business or the merchant. In the event that the company goes out of business or becomes insolvent, the Merchant Services Provider (MSP) will be responsible for paying the company's bills. This presents the MSP with a certain amount of financial risk.

Certain businesses, such as the marijuana industry, the bail bond industry, and guns, statistically pose a higher level of danger. In addition, firms that take online payments without the need for physical verification or those that automatically enroll clients in monthly payments after the first purchase are more likely to experience fraudulent activity and chargebacks.

Additionally, there is a possibility that chargebacks will increase for business models that provide subjective services. An example of this would be a consumer who disputes a purchase made on a website, stating that they are unhappy with the product's quality.

Having a "high risk" label does not indicate that there has been any wrongdoing; rather, it just indicates that there is a greater probability of chargebacks and fraud. It is a question of higher risk for a Merchant Account Provider to grant credit privileges to organizations that fall into this category.

To be more specific, what exactly is meant by the term "High Risk Merchant Account"?

### **Discovering the Secrets Behind the High-Risk Merchant Account Conception**

The purpose of a high-risk merchant account is to provide a specialized payment processing solution that is tailored to the needs of businesses that, statistically speaking, demonstrate financial unpredictability, an increased susceptibility to disputes and chargebacks, and consequently present a heightened potential for loss to both the merchant service provider and the bank that facilitates the technology and infrastructure for payment acceptance.

Getting into the area of establishing a high-risk merchant account generally entails forming a partnership with a company that supplies your company with the necessary resources to make credit card payments, regardless of whether they are made in-person or online.

A piece of advice from the experts: Make an effort to negotiate a deal that is more than just a transactional one. Aim for a solid partnership in which the merchant service provider acquires an in-depth understanding of your company, thereby cultivating a relationship that is robust and mutually beneficial.

### **The Function of the Merchant Account Provider:**

When a merchant service provider (also known as a merchant account provider, credit card processor, or simply merchant processor) collaborates with a firm, it provides several major functions:

* To offer the hardware, software, and infrastructure required for the merchant to accept credit card payments and receive funds for those purchases.
    
* On behalf of the company, the MSP engages with card companies (VISA/MC/etc.) and banks. When credit card transactions are handled, there are a lot of intricate moving elements going on behind the scenes, such as authorization, settlement, and so on, and the last thing a business owner wants to deal with is more stuff to deal with.
    
* In some ways, the MSP functions as a financial guarantor for the company. If the company experiences fraud, excessive chargebacks, or refunds it cannot pay, the MSP is left footing the price.
    

MSPs charge fees to deliver these services to business owners. There's nothing new there. And the fees are higher for merchants in high-risk categories.

For example, if you have a history of being in a lot of accidents and drive a very costly automobile, your insurance fees will be higher than the average.

The same is true for merchant accounts. When it comes to payment processing, if your business, industry, or marketing plan is deemed "high risk," you will face extra restrictions, fees, and so on.

So, why choose a high risk merchant account if they are more expensive?

### **Why Should You Opt for a High-Risk Merchant Account?**

Let's take a moment to discuss the advantages of high risk merchant accounts.

As a business owner, a seemingly logical question to ask yourself now is, "Why would I choose an account when I know the fees are going to be higher?"

That is an excellent question.

The easiest approach to answer that issue is to ask how long your company might exist without the capacity to accept payments other than cash or check.

High risk merchant accounts shield YOU from business risks in addition to lowering risk for the merchant account issuer.

Most business owners are unaware of this information (or are utterly unaware of the difference between high-risk and low-risk in the first place) and will just choose an MSP that is easy to set up and has minimal fees, such as Paypal.

1. Make an account
    
2. Enter some details
    
3. Done.
    

Sounds fantastic, but the issue is what happens when (not if, but when) something in your day-to-day business operations (or your industry or marketing model in general) raises a red flag in their system.

Something along the lines of:

* There are far too many chargebacks.
    
* Any sort of deception.
    
* A good month (for example, your company has a strong month, or runs a killer promotion, and has an unusually high number of transactions or transaction volume).
    
* Your website has been compromised.
    
* The MSP's policies change, and you are no longer covered.
    
* Fraud occurs against a major competitor in your industry.
    
* The public is paying more attention to your sector or marketing model.
    
* etc.
    

The next thing you know, your account has been frozen or closed.

For one day, you are unable to accept credit card payments. Perhaps two days. Perhaps a week. Maybe a little longer.

Your only option is to contact chat support with someone from India who plainly doesn't know or care about what's going on and hope that they have the authority to reactivate your account (good luck).

So, the actual advantage of using a high risk merchant account provider (when your firm is on the risk spectrum) is that they plan for all of this before your account is created.

### **Advantages of High-Risk Merchant Accounts**

* Underwriting
    
* Global Expansion Capability
    
* There are no volume limits.
    
* Chargeback issues have been reduced.
    
* Payment flow has been simplified.
    

#### **Underwriting**

First, let's dispel a widespread fallacy held by 99% of high-risk business owners. The error is to open an account with a business like as Paypal, Stripe, or Square and mistake it for a merchant account - after all, you can accept payments, right?

These businesses will let you utilize their merchant accounts. They are referred to as merchant account aggregators. They have no idea what you sell, how you market it, how you deliver it, or whether you deliver it at all.

They are banking on the premise that if someone is committing fraud, they can simply close the account and freeze your money - which happens all the time. They allow you to quickly create and deactivate accounts.

So, when your organization is on the risk spectrum, the major benefit of picking a high risk merchant account provider is peace of mind that you may continue commercial operations in the face of fraud, unusual activity, or a variety of other reasons.

How? With excellent underwriting.

The most important "trick" in obtaining a dependable merchant account is to deal with a vendor who thoroughly knows your business and genuinely wants to work with you.

MSPs who do their homework to understand you can assist protect you. When they know what to expect, they are considerably less likely to shut or freeze your account when things go wrong.

Inevitably? After all, you are a high-risk firm, therefore there is a good possibility something will go wrong.

Underwriting prepares your MSP and you for this unavoidable event.

#### **Examples of High Risk Classification Factors**

There are numerous elements that contribute to high risk. Let's look at some of the high risk variables that may categorize your company as a "high risk merchant."

* Low credit, bad credit, or no credit as all? This is true for both the business owner's personal credit score and the credit score associated with the EIN.
    
* There is no prior history or experience accepting credit cards.
    
* Any history of fraud or unlawful action by the company or its owner.
    
* The merchant does business (makes sales) on a global scale.
    
* Businesses that sell "reputational risk" products/services, which means that what they sell is potentially contentious from a PR standpoint and that banks simply do not want to be affiliated with (ex: adult products, marijuana smoking pipes, etc.).
    
* High-risk sectors tend to attract more negative individuals or bad behavior. When restrictions are stringent, it encourages people to breach the law in order to avoid them (have you seen the film The Wolf of Wall Street?) These industries are more likely to have merchants that violate laws/regulations and face penalties, closure, and other consequences (for example, alcohol, tobacco, guns, and financial products). It doesn't matter if your company is doing it; others in the industry are, which raises a red flag for banks.
    
* Orders/transactions can be placed via mail, phone, or online. Basically, if something may be purchased when the card owner is not physically there, a larger risk of fraud, chargebacks, and so on exists.
    
* The average transaction size is large. Chargeback losses are more severe when the item is pricey (would you rather repay someone for a $5 service or a $5,000 service?)
    
* Chargebacks have a history of being excessive. Excessive chargebacks deviate from typical charge-back ratios, indicating that something is wrong with the merchant's products/services, consumers, customer service, product delivery, sales strategies, or all of the above.
    

In addition to these considerations, many industries and business structures are considered high-risk by default, regardless of whether they fit the above list.

If your company falls into one of these categories, it may be classified as high-risk.

* Accounting and Tax Preparation

*It should be noted that some of these high-risk categories are rather substantial sectors in their own right, and may have unique intricacies when it comes to payment processing.*

Under the high-risk umbrella, some MSPs specialize in certain specialized niches. If your company falls into one of these categories, please have a look at the high risk merchant account providers listed below, as well as our specific evaluation articles for high risk providers by industry/category.

### **Factors to Consider When Choosing a High-Risk Merchant Account Provider**

Obtaining a high-risk merchant account requires mutual cooperation. The majority of what we have discussed is from the perspective of MSPs evaluating the firm for possible risk, however there are several factors you should consider as a business owner when selecting a provider.

After all, if you choose the wrong supplier for your company, you may find up paying higher-than-necessary fees, having your account closed, or being wrongly added to the TMF list.

Protect your company by taking the following factors into account when making your decision:

#### **Consideration No. 1: Experience and track record**

How much experience does the MSP have with high-risk situations, your industry, and your particular business type? How long have they been in business?

Is it possible for them to provide you with particular case studies or expert information on other clients with whom they have worked to assist you understand some of the usual challenges you may face - and prepare you for them in advance?

#### **Consideration 2: MSP Options**

What services and features do they offer in addition to a merchant account? Gateways, fraud detection, decline salvaging, transaction routing, reporting, and so forth.

#### **Consideration 3: Previous processing experience**

How much prior experience does your company have with credit card processing? Do you have data on critical high-risk indicators for your company, such as your chargeback ratio, monthly revenue fluctuation, and so on?

#### **4th consideration: adaptability and customisation**

Is the MSP you want to deal with able to tailor their service offering to your individual requirements?

#### **5th Point to Consider: Rolling Reserves**

How much cash need you put in rolling reserves to keep your account solvent? (Learn more about rolling reserves here).

Now that you know what factors to consider when choosing a merchant account provider, let's look at how to prepare for the signing process.

### **How to Get Ready for a High-Risk Merchant Account**

Not every merchant is approved for a merchant account. However, like with anything in business, coming prepared will offer your new MSP partner confidence that you have your ducks in a row, making their life (and faith in you) easier.

Make every effort to show yourself as helpful as possible, and ensure that people perceive you as a credible businessperson.

Let's start with an overview of the application process, followed by some suggestions on how you might prepare to have the best ride possible.

#### **The Application Procedure**

Consider the application process an opportunity to provide the underwriter with a clear, solid picture of your company.

Before submitting the application and documentation to an underwriter / processor, you must either have the knowledge to paint this picture yourself or hire someone to do it for you.

You only get one shot at making a solid first impression.

Your goal is to have an underwriter pick up your application package, scan it, and swiftly judge it as a solid, reduced risk firm - or, at the absolute least, a well-thought-out and developed business plan.

In addition to the initial filing, it is critical to understand how to deal with underwriters. They're basically simply seeking for reasons to refuse applications, so if you don't have someone dealing with underwriting departments for you, you should proceed with caution.

Let's go over what you need to do to get this done correctly.

#### **Preparation of an Application**

It's time to be ready for your big moment, so let's go over some pointers to help you get started right.

##### **TIP #1: GET SOME SKIN IN THE GAME**

Underwriters prefer enterprises with "skin in the game" in general.

This could include demonstrating that you have a physical location, a personal reputation that is obviously linked to your firm, personal investment in the company, inventory, and so on.

They want to ensure that you are fully devoted to your business.

##### **TIP #2: BE IN CONTROL OF YOUR BUSINESS.**

Outsourcing has become the new entrepreneur's catchphrase. But, for the same reason that it appeals to entrepreneurs, it is risky for processors; it is "hands off."

How much control do you truly have if your entire business is centered around a fulfillment firm that sends things for you? What happens if that company goes bankrupt? What will your customers do if their product is delayed for a week, a month, or even longer?

Chargebacks will occur.

The challenge for insurers is that they must now assess both the fulfillment house and your business.

Do you have an onshore team, similar to having skin in the game? Are you accountable for the families of people who know you and live in your community?

##### **TIP #3: NO MAGIC. TRICKS ARE FOR CHILDREN.**

There are numerous ways for a marketer to market a product or service. These range from "straightforward" to "extremely difficult," with a lot of gray in between.

Having free trials that automatically bill your clients after a certain amount of time (also known as "Negative Options"), or auto-checking a box on an order form that enrolls someone in a monthly recurring charge (also known as "Forced Continuity") - regardless of how visible that box is - will result in confused, upset customers.

Using deceptive marketing strategies usually results in more chargebacks. This irritates underwriters.

*Pro tip: Facebook does not appreciate it when their advertising are deceptive. If you want to stay in the "not tricky" area, look at Facebook advertising standards for tips on what to AVOID.*

##### **TIP #4: EXPLAIN BLACK MARKERS**

If you have a bankruptcy, low credit, a judgment against you, no credit, or have lately had unusually high returns or chargebacks for any reason, provide an explanation right away.

Please keep in mind that this is very much a case-by-case basis, and having assistance here is really beneficial as each situation varies. As with the law, what you say might sometimes work against you.

However, if you lack advice, the general rule of thumb here is to provide information such that the underwriter (or whoever is preparing your package) does not have to dig for it and draw their own conclusions.

Underwriters look at your credit, your business credit, your state and federal organization registrations, other processor's lists, and frequently your bank records - there's a lot of data there.

If you don't provide an explanation, you should presume the underwriter will see the "black marks" and form their own opinions.

##### **TIP #5: SAY "YES, SIR"**

Never ask an underwriter "why" they are requesting information. This puts them on the defensive right away.

You want to manipulate the situation by giving them as many reasons as possible to approve your account. They will have more trust in you if they regard you as an open book.

##### **TIP #6: BE AWARE OF THRESHOLDS.**

The amount of volume sought is one of the first things underwriters look at. It's all too often for business owners to become defensive and "tell underwriters" how much money they'll be processing.

A handful of crucial points:

To begin, the monthly volume listed on an application is a request for volume, not a demand.

Second, that figure should always be the same or somewhat higher than your present volume.

However, if you have no history or are currently performing low volume and predict a large increase in volume, it's critical to know the exact quantity to request and how to get to the volume you require.

For example, if you're a brand new firm or only processing $10,000 per month and say you'll be processing a million dollars next month, underwriters will want to see proof.

They'll also want to see a slew of documents to prove that you're financially secure enough to take on a million dollars in the next 30 days (tax returns, financials, bank statements, and so on).

You're far better off placing the most conservative figures possible on your applications and gradually expanding.

Underwriters will raise an eyebrow if you request a big increase in volume from your present level.

If you are certain that you will develop at that rate, we strongly advise you to work with someone who has experience navigating the underwriting process.
