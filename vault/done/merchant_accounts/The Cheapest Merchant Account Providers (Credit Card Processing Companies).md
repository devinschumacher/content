## What is Credit Card Processing?

As a business owner, you accept payments from your customers in exchange for goods and services.

Expanding your payment options can attract more customers and boost your business. To accept credit cards, you'll need a way to process these payments.

Credit card processing involves transferring the customer's funds from their credit card (or bank account, for debit card transactions) into your business bank account.

This process requires a payment processor to handle the various steps involved.

Here’s a breakdown of the key stages from when a customer pays to when you receive the funds:

### Step 1: Payment and Authorization

When a customer makes a purchase and provides their credit card details, these details are sent to the acquiring bank.

The acquiring bank, which facilitates transactions for the merchant, then forwards the information to the issuing bank—the bank that issued the customer's credit card.

The issuing bank performs a verification process, checking for available funds and validating the account's status.

Based on this verification, the issuing bank either approves or declines the transaction, sending a response back through the acquiring bank to the merchant.

### Step 2: Payment Authentication

Once the transaction information reaches the issuing bank, it undergoes a thorough check to ensure its validity. The issuing bank verifies critical details such as the Address Verification System (AVS) and the Card Verification Value (CVV).

These checks help confirm that the card is being used by the rightful owner and that the transaction is legitimate. If all the information matches and is verified, the issuing bank approves the payment.

At this point, the funds are earmarked or held in the cardholder’s account, awaiting the next steps in the transaction process.

### Step 3: Batching and Settlement

At the end of the business day, the merchant compiles all the approved transactions into a batch and sends this batch to their acquiring bank.

The acquiring bank processes the batch, releasing the funds from the issuing banks and deducting any transaction fees that apply.

This process ensures that the funds are appropriately transferred from the cardholders' accounts to the merchant’s account.

The batching and settlement process consolidates multiple transactions, streamlining the transfer of funds and the deduction of fees.

### Step 4: Merchant Receives Funds

Once the acquiring bank has processed the batch and settled the transactions, it deposits the funds into the merchant’s business bank account.

This deposit makes the funds available for the merchant to use, completing the payment cycle.

The time it takes for the funds to be accessible can vary depending on the acquiring bank's policies and the merchant's agreement with the bank, but typically, it is a prompt process.

The merchant can then use these funds for operational expenses, reinvestment, or other business needs.

## Merchant Account Providers vs. Payment Processors: What’s the Difference?

To process payments, you need a merchant account, which is distinct from a business bank account.

A merchant account is held by your acquiring bank and temporarily holds the funds before transferring them to your business bank account.

The company that provides you with a merchant account is known as a merchant account provider.

Some companies offer both merchant accounts and payment processing services, while others specialize in one or the other.

## The Appeal of Affordable Payment Processing Companies

Running a business involves various expenses, making cost-saving opportunities valuable.

Some payment processing companies charge exorbitant rates, and without proper knowledge, you might fall for their marketing tactics.

Understanding different pricing plans can help you avoid unnecessary costs.

## Exploring Different Pricing Plans

Payment processing isn’t one-size-fits-all. Here are the common pricing plans:

### Flat-Rate Pricing

Flat-rate pricing involves a single rate for all transactions, though the rate can vary based on how the payment information is entered.

Swiped transactions usually have a lower rate than manually keyed-in transactions, reflecting the lower risk of card-present transactions.

While straightforward, flat-rate pricing might not always be transparent and could be costly in the long run.

### Tiered Pricing

Tiered pricing categorizes transactions into three tiers: non-qualified, mid-qualified, and qualified.

Qualified transactions, such as card-present and debit card transactions, get the lowest rates due to their lower risk.

Non-qualified transactions, like card-not-present and reward card transactions, incur higher rates. This model can lack transparency and might not be the most cost-effective option.

### Interchange-Plus Pricing

Interchange-plus pricing is often favored for its transparency. Interchange fees, set by major credit card companies, are added to a markup by the payment processor.

For instance, a rate might be 2.2% + $0.15 per transaction. However, factors like card type and transaction method can influence these fees.

### Surcharge Pricing and Cash Discounts

Surcharge pricing adds an extra fee for credit card payments to cover transaction costs, meaning the merchant pays nothing for those sales.

Cash discount programs offer a discount to customers paying with cash, check, or debit card while adding a fee for credit card payments.

These models shift payment processing costs to customers, which many business owners find appealing.

## Comparing Merchant Services Providers and Payment Aggregators

You might consider a payment aggregator like Square or Stripe for its convenience and quick account approval.

However, using an aggregator means your funds are sent to a shared master merchant account before reaching you. This lack of a dedicated merchant account poses risks, such as frozen funds due to chargebacks.

In contrast, a merchant services provider offers individual merchant accounts, sometimes setting up multiple accounts to safeguard your access to funds in case of issues. This approach minimizes the risk of losing access to your money.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing an Affordable Payment Processor

With the basics covered, let's delve into the key aspects you should evaluate before selecting a budget-friendly merchant services provider.

### Evaluating Hardware and Software Costs

How will you handle payments? If you plan to use a POS system or credit card terminal, do you already have one, or will you need to buy it?

Pro Tip: Leasing can quickly become costly, so try to avoid it.

For online payments via a gateway or virtual terminal, do you have the necessary setup? Are you integrating with a shopping cart?

Consider these factors to identify which companies can cater to your specific needs.

### Assessing Your Processing Volume

Knowing your average monthly processing volume and ticket price is crucial.

Be honest about your figures, and if you anticipate business growth, inform potential processors about your expected increase.

### Understanding Monthly Maintenance Fees

Some payment processors don't charge monthly fees, or they keep them minimal. Choosing such providers can help keep your costs low, provided they meet your other criteria.

However, monthly maintenance fees are common, so be prepared for this expense.

## Key Questions to Ask Before Committing

Before reaching out to processors, here are essential questions to address before signing any contracts.

### Clarifying Payment Processing Terms

Credit card processing involves many unfamiliar terms. Don't hesitate to ask questions like:

* What does interchange-plus mean?
* What is a chargeback?
* What does PCI Compliance entail, and what if I'm not compliant?
    

Getting clear answers now can prevent confusion later.

### What Happens When My Business Grows?

If your transaction volume increases, it could affect your fees. Ensure you get a written explanation of what to expect as your business grows.

### What is Your Customer Service Like?

Payment processing issues are inevitable. Ensure your processor offers reliable customer service to address problems promptly, preventing potential customer loss.

## Additional Tips

Here are a few more tips to keep in mind:

### Avoid Monthly Minimums

Watch out for processors that impose monthly minimums, which can incur fees if you don't meet the required volume. This can significantly impact small businesses.

### Identify Hidden Fees

Contracts may include hidden fees such as retrieval fees, return fees, and annual fees. Clarify any "other fees" listed in your contract.

### Add ACH as a Payment Option

ACH payments, which involve bank transfers, usually cost less in transaction fees. Offering this option can reduce your processing costs.

### Shop Around for the Best Deals

With numerous credit card processors available, it's crucial to research and compare rates and services to find the best match for your needs.

### Avoid Long-Term Contracts

Long-term contracts can be challenging and expensive to cancel. Opt for month-to-month agreements to avoid costly early termination fees.
