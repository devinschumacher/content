Each of these credit card processors offers unique advantages tailored to different business needs, ensuring that you can find the best fit for your specific requirements while keeping costs low.

## What is Credit Card Processing?

As a business owner, you accept payments from your customers in exchange for your products and services. Accepting multiple payment methods can help you reach more customers and boost your business.

To accept credit cards, you need a system to process these payments.

Credit card processing involves transferring the customer's money from their credit card (or bank account, in the case of debit card payments) into your business bank account.

There are several steps involved in this process, and that's where a payment processor comes in.

Here are the basic steps, from the moment the customer pays to the moment you receive the funds:

### Step 1: Payment and Authorization

The credit card information is sent to the acquiring bank, which then sends it to the issuing bank.

The issuing bank either approves or declines the transaction after verifying the necessary information.

### Step 2: Payment Authentication

The issuing bank checks all the required information, such as AVS and CVV, before approving the payment.

If everything matches, the transaction is approved, and a hold is placed on the funds in the cardholder’s account.

### Step 3: Batching and Settlement

At the end of the day, the merchant sends all approved transactions in a batch to their acquiring bank (merchant account). The funds are released, and any transaction fees are deducted.

### Step 4: Merchant Receives Funds

The acquiring bank deposits the funds into the merchant’s business bank account, making them accessible.

## Merchant Account Provider vs. Payment Processor

To process payments, you need a merchant account, which is different from a business bank account.

A merchant account is held by your acquiring bank and acts as a temporary holding place for the money people pay you before it is transferred to your business bank account.

The company that provides you with a merchant account is called a merchant account provider.

Some companies offer both merchant accounts and payment processing services, while others specialize in only one.

## Benefits of a Low-Cost Payment Processing Company

Running a business comes with numerous expenses, so it's essential to save money whenever possible.

Some payment processing companies charge exorbitant rates, and if you're not careful, you could be swayed by their marketing tactics.

It's crucial to understand the different pricing plans and know what to look for and what to avoid.

## Types of Pricing Plans

There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to payment processing. Here are some pricing plan options:

### Flat-Rate Pricing

This involves charging one rate for all transactions, but the rate can vary depending on how the payment information was entered.

For example, a lower rate might apply to swiped transactions, while a higher rate applies to manually keyed-in transactions.

This method is simple but not always transparent and could be costlier in the long run.

### Tiered Pricing

Transactions are categorized into one of three tiers—non-qualified, mid-qualified, and qualified.

Qualified transactions (e.g., card-present, debit cards) get the lowest rates due to their low risk, while non-qualified transactions (e.g., card-not-present, rewards cards) get the highest rates.

This model lacks transparency and may not be ideal if you seek the cheapest credit card processing.

### Interchange-Plus Pricing

This is often the best option for its transparency. Interchange fees, set by major credit card companies twice a year, are combined with a markup from the payment processing company.

For example, an interchange-plus fee might be 2.2% + $0.15 per transaction. The types of cards used and whether the transaction is card-present or card-not-present can affect this pricing.

### Surcharge Pricing and Cash Discounts

Surcharge pricing involves charging credit card-paying customers an additional fee to cover transaction costs, meaning the merchant pays nothing for those sales.

Cash discount programs offer a discount to customers paying with cash, checks, or debit cards and charge an extra fee to those paying with credit cards.

These models can pass the cost of payment processing to customers, which many business owners find appealing.

## Merchant Services Provider vs. Payment Aggregator

You might consider choosing a payment aggregator over a merchant services provider. Companies like Square or Stripe offer nearly instant account approval, making it easier to start processing payments.

However, they differ significantly and can be more costly.

Payment aggregators provide services in exchange for transaction fees. Customer payments are sent to a master merchant account used by multiple businesses before being sent to you.

This lack of a dedicated merchant account can be risky.

Excessive chargebacks could lead to frozen funds, potentially losing access to them for months.

In contrast, a merchant account provider gives you your own merchant account(s).

Some providers set up multiple accounts per merchant to ensure that, if there is a problem with the funds, you won't lose access to all your money.

## What to Consider Before Choosing the Cheapest Payment Processing Company

Having covered the basics, let’s delve into what you should consider before selecting a low-cost merchant services provider.

### The Cost of Hardware and/or Software

How will you handle payments?

If you plan on using a POS system or credit card terminal, do you already own them, or will you need to buy them?

Pro Tip: Avoid leasing these devices, as it can become costly very quickly.

If you intend to process payments online through a payment gateway or virtual terminal, do you have the necessary setup?

Are you integrating with a shopping cart?

These are crucial factors to consider to determine which companies can best meet your needs.

### Your Processing Volume

It’s vital to know your average monthly processing volume and ticket price. Provide accurate figures, not estimates that are too high or low.

Be honest, and if you anticipate growth within the next year, make sure every processor you talk to is aware of this potential increase.

### Monthly Maintenance Fees

Some payment processors don’t charge monthly fees, or they keep them minimal. Opting for one of these can help you keep costs down, provided they meet your other criteria.

Generally, monthly maintenance fees are standard, so you should expect this charge.

## Questions to Ask Before Making a Commitment

Before you reach out to any processors, there are essential questions you should ask before signing any contracts.

### What Does [Insert Payment Processing Term Here] Mean?

As you delve into credit card processing, you’ll encounter many unfamiliar terms. Don’t hesitate to ask questions, such as:

* What does interchange-plus mean?
* What is a chargeback?
* What does it mean to remain PCI Compliant, and what if I’m not?
    

Getting these answers now can prevent confusion later.

### What Happens When My Business Grows?

If last year your business processed a million dollars in transactions and this year you’re set to double that, what will happen?

Changes in transaction volume can impact your fees, so ensure you get written details on what to expect as your business grows.

### What is Your Customer Service Like?

Processing payments can lead to problems, such as issues with your payment gateway or rejected transactions.

Ensure your processor offers adequate customer service to handle these situations, as poor service can result in lost customers.

## A Few More Tips to Keep in Mind...

### Try to Avoid Monthly Minimums

Be cautious of processors that require monthly minimums, which mandate a certain transaction volume each month.

Failing to meet this can incur fees, which can eat into your profits, even if the fee seems small.

### Seek Out “Hidden” Fees

Watch for hidden fees that might not be clearly mentioned in your contract, such as:

* Retrieval fees
* Return fees
* Annual fees
    

If your contract mentions “other fees,” inquire about what these are. Ask questions if anything is unclear or seems unreasonable.

### Add ACH as a Payment Option

ACH payments allow customers to pay via bank funds transfer, which typically incurs lower transaction fees for merchants.

Utilizing this option can significantly reduce your payment processing costs.

### Shop Around to Find the Best Deals

Many credit card processors claim to offer the lowest rates and fees. Research and compare multiple options to find the best rates and services for your needs.

### Don’t Agree to Long-Term Contracts

When starting with a payment processor, you’ll sign a contract for a set period. Long-term contracts, such as those lasting five years, can be difficult and costly to cancel.

A month-to-month contract is more flexible and can save you from expensive early termination fees.
