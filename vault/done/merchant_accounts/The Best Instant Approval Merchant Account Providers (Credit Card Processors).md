For business owners, (also known as a merchant), the idea of being approved for a merchant account in an instant may seem like a dream come true.

The fact of the matter is that there are no merchant accounts that are approved instantly under any circumstances. Additionally, there is typically a waiting period of some kind.

## What is Instant Approval Payment Processing?

Instant approval in payment processing means you are almost immediately approved for a merchant account upon application. While some companies are quicker than others in approving accounts, true instant approval is rare.

If speed is your priority, you might want to consider a payment aggregator. However, there are several reasons to be cautious, which we’ll discuss shortly.

Each merchant services provider has its own underwriting process. Some can offer same-day approval, enabling you to start accepting payments almost immediately.

## Why Merchants Might Seek Instant Approval

There are various reasons why a merchant may need rapid approval for credit card processing services:

1.  They are new to business and eager to start accepting payments quickly.
2.  They are dissatisfied with their current payment processor or merchant account provider.
3.  They run a low-risk business that should be easy to approve.
    

## Does Instant Approval Equate to Instant Funding?

Some business owners assume that quick approval for a merchant account means they will also receive their funds quickly. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case.

### Next Day Funding

With next-day funding, sales made today are paid out the following business day. For example, if your processor has a 5 pm cutoff for batching, funds batched by that time will be received the next day.

Some providers might also make deposits on weekends, but most follow regular banking hours.

### Same Day Funding

Same-day funding requires early batching, typically around 11 am. After batching, funds are sent to your business bank account.

This option is popular for businesses operating overnight but may have limits on accessible funds, with the balance available through next-day funding.

### Instant Deposits

Instant deposits come with higher transaction fees and are often only available through payment aggregators rather than traditional merchant account providers.

## Distinguishing Instant Approval Merchant Accounts from Payment Aggregators

Instant approval from merchant account providers differs from using a payment aggregator. Companies like Stripe, PayPal, and Square are common for newcomers to payment processing, offering:

* Instant approvals
* Quick access to cash
* Ease of use
* Transparent terms and fees
    

However, they can be volatile, with the risk of frozen funds or account closures without notice. It's generally better to wait a day or two for merchant account approval to avoid potential issues.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing an Instant Approval Credit Card Processor

Before selecting a payment processor, consider the following:

### Contract Terms

You’ll likely need to sign a contract with any merchant service provider. Many offer month-to-month contracts, but scrutinize any agreement for:

* Hidden fees not disclosed by sales representatives.
* Contract duration; avoid long-term commitments like five years.
* Early termination penalties, which can be substantial.
* Equipment leases; purchasing your own hardware is more cost-effective.
    

### Transaction Fees

Understand how transaction fees are calculated, which varies by processor:

* Flat rate pricing: One rate for all transactions.
* Tiered pricing: Transactions categorized as qualified, mid-qualified, or non-qualified, with non-qualified carrying higher fees.
* Interchange-plus pricing: The most transparent but complex, combining interchange costs set by credit card companies with the processor’s fee.
    

Some providers offer cash discount or surcharge programs to reduce processing costs. Review the fine print to ensure a beneficial deal.

### Company Reputation

Choose a provider with a strong reputation among customers.

Research profiles on the Better Business Bureau, Facebook, and Yelp. Avoid companies with numerous customer complaints and seek those with satisfied clients.

## How to Improve Your Chances of Getting Approved for a Merchant Account Fast

Waiting for your merchant account to be approved can be frustrating when you're eager to start processing payments for your business. However, there are several steps you can take to expedite the process.

### Submit All Requested Paperwork

Delays in merchant account approvals often occur because the processor lacks the necessary documentation for underwriting.

You can avoid this issue by promptly providing all required paperwork when you submit your application. Some of the documents you might need include:

* A photo ID or passport
* Your business plan
* Three months of personal banking statements
* Three months of business banking statements (if available)
* A personal letter of reference from your bank
* Articles of incorporation or association
* Your business website URL
* A personal utility bill to verify your address
* Any other pertinent information that may help expedite approval
    

### Be Honest About Your Business and Processing History

Honesty is crucial when dealing with merchant account providers. Concealing information can have serious repercussions for your business and its ability to accept credit card payments.

For instance, if you operate a CBD store, disclose this to the provider. Payment processing for CBD is challenging to find, and attempting to bypass high-risk credit card processing fees by being dishonest can lead to significant issues.

It could result in being placed on the MATCH list, making it nearly impossible to find a processor willing to work with you. Being truthful enables the provider to offer the best possible service.

### Make Sure Your Website is Up to Date and Informative

Your merchant account provider will review your website before approving your application.

Ensure that your website includes customer policies, up-to-date products, and comprehensive information for visitors.

This demonstrates the legitimacy of your business and reduces the perceived risk of working with you.

## A Few More Tips…

### Look for a Processor That Will Help You Prevent Chargebacks

Chargebacks pose a significant problem in the credit card processing industry and can create substantial issues for your business if they occur frequently.

A chargeback happens when a customer disputes a credit card charge with their issuing bank. The best payment processors offer chargeback protection and preventive measures.

For instance, if a customer didn't receive a purchased item and requests a chargeback, knowing about it in advance allows you to offer a refund, preventing the chargeback and avoiding excessive fees.

### Disclose Any High-Value Transactions

Inform your provider’s underwriting department of any potential high-value transactions before they occur, especially if your business typically has low-value sales.

For example, if you usually sell perfume for around $100 a bottle but plan to introduce a new brand priced at $1,000 a bottle, notify the processor about the higher-value transactions.

### Be Prepared for Additional Fees if Your Business is High-Risk

High-risk businesses often face additional fees. You might incur higher transaction fees per sale and may also be required to maintain a rolling reserve.

A rolling reserve involves setting aside a portion of your sales each month to cover potential chargebacks.

Many processors require this for high-risk merchants, with the funds typically released after a set period, usually six months.

Although you may not always need a rolling reserve, it’s important to be aware of this possibility.
