## Is it Legal for Cannabis Businesses to Accept Credit Card Payments?

Many cannabis merchants assume it's illegal to process credit card payments for their products. However, this isn't entirely accurate.

In the United States, major banks and credit unions are governed by federal regulations. Since cannabis is federally illegal, this introduces higher risk levels for financial institutions.

In 2013, the Department of Justice issued the Cole Memo, which prevents prosecutors from targeting legal cannabis businesses that comply with state regulations.

Thus, a gray area exists.

As a cannabis dispensary merchant, you can process credit card payments for your products, provided you understand the correct procedure.

## Understanding Cannabis Merchant Account Services

It all starts with establishing the appropriate merchant account services. You need two primary components:

1.  Merchant Accounts: Preferably multiple accounts where your sales revenue will be deposited.
2.  Payment Processing Company: This entity will handle payment acceptance, approval, and transfer of funds into your merchant accounts before depositing into your business bank account.
    

High-risk merchant account providers typically offer both services.

## Benefits of Accepting Credit Cards for Cannabis Payments

[Research](https://www.creditcards.com/statistics/payment-method-statistics-1276/) indicates a majority of people prefer paying with credit or debit cards over cash.

Only 19% of people prefer cash payments, meaning 81% use other forms of payment.

People appreciate the convenience of using cards and tend to patronize businesses that accommodate this preference.

## Alternative Payment Methods for Cannabis Sales

You don't have to accept credit cards at your dispensary, but other methods can seem questionable and aren't recommended.

Instead of collaborating with a cannabis payment processing company, you could:

* Continue accepting cash payments only: This could lead to lost revenue.
* Misrepresent your products: For example, some New York "sticker" stores offer a free cannabis gift with sticker purchases.
* Offer cashless ATM services: This processes payments as debit transactions, often leading to quick shutdowns.
* Accept electronic checks and ACH transfers: This requires a special app, which can be difficult to get customers to download.
    

These alternatives can be problematic, so working with a company experienced in cannabis payment processing is advisable.

## Why Cannabis Businesses Are Considered High-Risk

Apart from legal issues, several factors contribute to cannabis businesses being considered high-risk.

### Chargebacks

All businesses face chargebacks, but the risk is higher in the cannabis industry.

If a customer isn't satisfied with a product purchased for a specific ailment, they might not be able to return it and may file a chargeback with their credit card company.

Higher chargeback rates increase your risk level, possibly leading to loss of merchant account services.

### Merchant Category Codes (MCCs)

Since cannabis is federally illegal, there are no specific MCCs for sales. Many merchants use MCCs for other products, but this can jeopardize their merchant accounts.

Some merchant account providers specialize in working with cannabis businesses and understand how to navigate these challenges.

## Selecting the Right Cannabis Payment Processing Company

Choosing the right marijuana credit card processor requires careful consideration. Here's what to look for:

### Evaluate Their Reputation

Evaluate the reputation of a cannabis merchant account provider by asking:

* Have they ever abruptly terminated a merchant account? If so, why?
* Do they offer merchant accounts domestically or offshore?
* What are their online reviews like?
* Do they have a good rating with the BBB?
    

Gathering this information will help you make an informed decision.

### Ensure Transparency in Pricing

Your marijuana credit card processor should be transparent about pricing and fees to avoid surprises later.

The average rate for cannabis processing is about 5.95% + $0.30 per transaction, though this can vary. Annual or monthly fees and a rolling reserve (typical for high-risk merchants) might also apply.

A rolling reserve means the provider holds back a percentage of sales for six months to cover chargeback fees.

### Assess Their Reliability

Choose a payment processor with reliable software. Frequent downtime is inconvenient for you and your customers and could cost you business.

Ask about the provider's average uptime, and be wary if they refuse to disclose this information.

### Consider Scalability

The cannabis industry is projected to reach [$43 billion by 2025](https://www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2021/06/18/legal-cannabis-market-projected-to-rack-up-43-billion-by-2025-says-new-study/?sh=6379436436b4). Your payment processor should be able to scale with your business as it grows.

Ensure they understand the industry’s projected growth and can support your expansion.

## Tips for Choosing the Best Cannabis Merchant Account Provider

Ready to research and contact marijuana payment processing companies? Here are some additional tips:

### Tip #1: Read All Contracts Carefully

Excitement about opening your business or accepting credit card payments can cause you to overlook contract details. Avoid long-term contracts (3-5 years) if possible.

Choose a provider offering month-to-month agreements to avoid high termination fees. If you need a POS system or terminal from the provider, read that separate contract carefully.

### Tip #2: Open More Than One Merchant Account

Having multiple merchant accounts mitigates the risk of losing substantial money due to processing issues.

If one account faces issues (like a high number of chargebacks), having additional accounts can minimize financial disruptions.

### Tip #3: Never Settle for Less Than Excellent Customer Service

Ensure your processor offers reliable customer service and tech support, preferably around the clock, to resolve issues promptly and avoid business interruptions.

### Bonus Tip: Avoid Leasing Your Payment Processing Equipment

Leasing POS systems or credit card terminals is costly. Purchase equipment outright if possible, or use virtual terminals or payment gateways to save on fees.

Ensure your chosen provider can integrate their software with your existing equipment to reduce costs.

## Navigating the Green Frontier of Cannabis Payment Processing

Navigating the complexities of credit card payment processing in the cannabis industry can be challenging, but it is achievable with the right knowledge and partners.

By understanding the legal landscape, recognizing the benefits of accepting credit cards, and choosing a reliable payment processing company, cannabis merchants can enhance their business operations and meet customer preferences effectively.

Thorough research and careful selection of a payment processor will not only ensure compliance with regulations but also foster business growth and customer satisfaction.
