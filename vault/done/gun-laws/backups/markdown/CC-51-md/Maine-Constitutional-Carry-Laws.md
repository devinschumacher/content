### Maine Gun Control Laws

### Constitutional Rights

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms. Maine‚Äôs constitution echoes this, stating that ‚Äúevery citizen has a right to keep and bear arms, and this right shall never be questioned.‚Äù However, this right is not without limitations, balancing public safety and gun ownership rights.

### Recent Events and Legislative Response

On October 25, 2023, a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, highlighted the state‚Äôs gun laws. The shooter, an Army reservist, killed 18 people and injured 13 others before being found dead. This tragedy prompted Maine‚Äôs governor to urge the legislature to consider tightening gun restrictions, especially concerning background checks and mental health assessments. The potential for new legislation remains uncertain, as lawmakers debate the effectiveness of proposed changes.

### Federal and State Laws

Federal laws, such as the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), establish regulations for firearm manufacture, use, sale, and possession. The NFA regulates certain weapons and requires registration, while the GCA bars specific individuals from firearm ownership, including those with felony convictions and domestic violence misdemeanors. Background checks are mandatory for purchases from federally licensed dealers to prevent illegal ownership.

### Maine‚Äôs Gun Laws

Maine‚Äôs laws emphasize gun ownership and safety, particularly for hunting and recreational shooting. Advocates for gun control encourage the state to implement universal background checks and consider bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

In 2015, Maine introduced a ‚Äúpermitless carry‚Äù law, allowing individuals 21 and older who can legally possess a firearm to carry it concealed without a permit. While this law is seen as a potential risk by some, Maine maintains a concealed carry permit system for reciprocity with other states, administered by the Maine State Police, local police chiefs, or sheriffs.

### Preemption and Local Regulations

Maine‚Äôs preemption statute restricts local municipalities from enacting their own firearms regulations, with the exception of controlling the discharge of firearms within their areas.

### Firearms in Vehicles and Workplace Policies

Individuals over 21 who are not prohibited from owning firearms may have them in motor vehicles. Exceptions exist for those 18‚Äì20 years old serving in the military, National Guard, or law enforcement. Employers cannot prevent employees with concealed carry permits from storing firearms in their locked vehicles, provided the firearms are not visible.

### Restricted Locations

Carrying firearms is prohibited in specific locations, including:

  * Courthouses
  * Schools
  * Federal buildings
  * State capitol grounds and buildings in Augusta
  * Establishments serving liquor for on-premises consumption
  * Correctional facilities and jails
  * Acadia National Park and state parks
  * Private premises where prohibited by the owner
  * Labor disputes and strikes



### Firearm Safety Requirements

While Maine does not require a firearm permit, dealers must provide a firearm safety brochure with each sale and offer information on local safety programs. They are also required to demonstrate the use of trigger-locking devices to buyers.
