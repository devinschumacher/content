### Massachusetts Gun Control Laws

Massachusetts has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, including extensive requirements for firearm ownership, possession, and use. The state also bans assault weapons, often used in mass shootings, and had the lowest gun violence death rate in the U.S. in 2021.

While strong gun control laws address public safety concerns, those ineligible to buy or possess guns in Massachusetts may still acquire weapons in states with fewer restrictions. Balancing the constitutional right to bear arms with the need for public safety is a significant challenge for states.

### Federal Firearms Laws

New firearms laws at the federal level are rare due to a divided Congress. Existing federal laws limit ownership of certain dangerous weapons like machine guns and restrict certain individuals from possessing firearms. Law enforcement uses the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.

### Massachusetts Gun Control Laws

Massachusetts‚Äô gun laws aim to prevent illegal possession and use of firearms, requiring universal background checks for every firearm purchase, sale, or transfer. These regulations review the buyer‚Äôs criminal and mental health history.

### Gun License Laws

Residents must apply for a License to Carry Firearms (LTC) to purchase, possess, and transport all legal handguns, rifles, shotguns, magazines, feeding devices, and ammunition. Those only seeking to purchase, possess, and transport non-large capacity rifles and shotguns apply for a Firearm Identification Card (FID).

The local chief of police is typically the licensing authority. Applicants must complete a state-approved firearms safety course or a qualifying hunter education course, submit fingerprints, and pass a background check.

Massachusetts does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states. Nonresidents with a concealed carry license from another state may carry a pistol or revolver into Massachusetts under specific conditions, such as participating in a competition, attending a firearms collectors‚Äô meeting, or hunting with a valid license.

### Storage Law

Firearms must be secured in a locked container or equipped with a mechanical lock or safety device when not under the owner‚Äôs control. This ensures the weapon is inoperable by anyone other than the owner or authorized user.

### Local Gun Regulations

Cities and counties in Massachusetts can enact firearm restrictions that may be stricter than state laws. Gun owners should be aware of both state and local regulations. Local police departments provide information on these laws, such as Boston‚Äôs online guide for firearm ownership.

### Efforts to Regulate Ghost Guns

State lawmakers are working to regulate undetectable ‚Äúghost‚Äù guns. Both the State Senate and House have passed provisions to outlaw 3D-printed guns without serial numbers that can bypass metal detectors. A conference committee will reconcile the bills for final approval in 2024.
