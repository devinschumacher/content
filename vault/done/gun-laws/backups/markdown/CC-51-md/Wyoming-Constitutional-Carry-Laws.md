### Wyoming Gun Control Laws Overview

Wyoming gun control laws are among the least restrictive in the United States, placing few obstacles to gun ownership and purchase. In 2021, Wyoming ranked 5th highest in gun death rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly half of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. come from suicide, and four in ten come from homicide.

Wyoming seeks to balance individual rights to bear arms set forth in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution with legitimate public safety concerns. It must also comply with federal firearm restrictions, including prohibitions on ownership or possession of firearms by individuals under indictment for or convicted of a felony, those convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense, and those currently subject to a domestic violence protection order.

### Wyoming Gun Control Laws

Every state has its own gun control laws that restrict the purchase and use of firearms. Wyoming, known as the Cowboy State, has relatively lenient gun control laws:

  * **No License Required** : Wyoming law does not require a license, permit, or registration to buy or own a firearm.
  * **Minimum Age** : The minimum age to buy a long gun (rifle or shotgun) is 18, and the minimum age to buy a handgun (pistol or revolver) is 21.



### Permitless Carry

  * **Residents** : Wyoming adopted a permitless carry law for residents in 2011, allowing those who would qualify for a concealed carry permit to carry without a permit.
  * **Non-Residents** : This law was expanded in 2021 to cover otherwise qualified non-residents.



### Concealed Firearms Permit (CFP)

The state maintains a CFP for residents seeking reciprocity in other states. A state permit also lets permit holders forego an otherwise required background check when purchasing a new firearm from a federally licensed dealer.

### Obtaining a Concealed Firearms Permit

  * **Authority** : The Wyoming Attorney General‚Äôs office issues permits. To apply for a CFP, contact your local sheriff‚Äôs office. The sheriff then forwards your permit application to the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) for review and background check.
  * **‚ÄúShall Issue‚Äù State** : Wyoming is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning that if you meet all the objective eligibility criteria, they must issue the concealed handgun permit.
  * **Validity** : Permits remain valid for five years. The state can pursue revocation if a permittee becomes ineligible in the future.



### Prohibited Locations for Firearms

Wyoming law includes a list of prohibited locations where carrying a firearm is not allowed:

  * Facilities used primarily for law enforcement or by a law enforcement agency
  * Detention facilities, prisons, or jails
  * Courtrooms (unless excepted by the judge)
  * Meetings of governmental entities
  * Meetings of the legislature or its committees
  * School, college, or professional athletic events not related to firearms
  * Places that sell liquor for consumption on premises
  * Elementary and secondary schools
  * College or university facilities (unless with consent of their security)



### Other Regulations

  * **Assault Weapons and Ghost Guns** : Wyoming law does not regulate the possession of assault weapons or ghost guns, which are firearms that can be assembled from a kit or through the use of a 3D printer.
  * **Background Checks** : No background checks are mandated for purchasing a gun through a private sale.
  * **Waiting Period** : There is no waiting period from the time of purchase to the time of delivery when buying a firearm.
  * **State Preemption Law** : Wyoming bans local authorities from passing stricter gun laws than the state.
  * **Firearms Manufactured in Wyoming** : A state law provides that firearms manufactured and not leaving Wyoming in interstate commerce do not fall under federal regulations, though this law has never been tested in court.



### Relevant Statutes

Wyoming‚Äôs gun laws can be found in Wyoming Statutes, Title 6, Chapter 8, Sections 6‚Äì8‚Äì101 through 6‚Äì8‚Äì406, and Title 21, Chapter 8, Section 21‚Äì3‚Äì132:

  * **Use or possession of a firearm by a person convicted of certain felony offenses** ‚Äî Section 6‚Äì8‚Äì102
  * **Wearing or carrying concealed weapons** ‚Äî Section 6‚Äì8‚Äì104
  * **Regulation of firearms** ‚Äî Section 6‚Äì8‚Äì404
  * **Possession of firearms on school property** ‚Äî Section 21‚Äì3‚Äì132



### Prohibited Firearms

Wyoming does not prohibit specific firearms but bans the use of a fully automatic weapon to take wildlife under its hunting regulations.

### Waiting Period

Wyoming has no waiting period for purchasing a firearm.

### Restrictions on Gun Ownership

Wyoming law provides that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a violent felony (except in situations where they received a pardon or had rights restored under the law)
  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a nonviolent felony (except in situations where they received a pardon or had rights restored under the law)



Federal law provides that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have been convicted of any felony in any state, territory, or other jurisdiction of the United States
  * Are a fugitive from justice
  * Are an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance
  * Have been adjudicated to be mentally defective or been committed to any mental institution
  * Are an illegal noncitizen
  * Have been discharged from the military under dishonorable conditions
  * Have renounced U.S. citizenship
  * Are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of an intimate partner
  * Have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence



### Concealed Carry License Requirements

Wyoming issues concealed carry permits, but they are not required for a Wyoming resident or lawful U.S. citizen to carry a concealed firearm. If a resident is eligible for a permit, they may carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Permits are still available for residents who wish to be able to carry a concealed firearm in states that recognize Wyoming permits.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Wyoming, and no permit or license is required to open carry.

  * Not have been committed to a state or federal facility for the abuse of a controlled substance within one year before applying for the permit

  * Not have been convicted of a misdemeanor violation of the Wyoming Controlled Substances Act or similar laws of any other state or the United States relating to controlled substances within one year before applying for the permit
  * Not chronically or habitually use alcohol to the extent that the person‚Äôs normal faculties are impaired
  * Demonstrate familiarity with a firearm through completion of a firearm safety or training course, law enforcement experience, experience competing in organized handgun shooting competitions, or military service
  * Not be currently adjudicated to be legally incompetent
  * Not have been committed to a mental institution



### Machine Gun Laws
