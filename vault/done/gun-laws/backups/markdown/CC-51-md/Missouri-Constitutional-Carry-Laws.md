### Overview of Missouri Gun Laws

Gun issues are a thorny topic. While the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, states have some freedom to regulate the sale and ownership of guns. Missouri gun control laws are relatively loose compared to other states. Missouri gun laws do not provide for waiting periods or require background checks for gun purchases from unlicensed individuals.

Gun regulations appear in both state and federal law. The federal government sets up licensing for firearms dealers and sets certain prohibitions on weapons and those who can possess them. State law may then provide restrictions on the carrying of firearms.

States can also set licensing requirements. Some states ban certain deadly weapons in response to gun violence. Others set laws to promote gun safety, often to reduce access to guns by minors.

### Missouri Gun Control Laws at a Glance

State lawmakers often struggle to balance the rights of gun owners with the need for public safety. Gun violence, such as the 2024 mass shooting at the Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City, brings the issue of guns back into public view.

The state of Missouri continues to tip the balance in favor of gun rights in most circumstances. Missouri does not ban assault weapons or require firearm owners to register their weapons. It does not require a license to purchase a firearm.

State lawmakers passed a permitless carry law in 2017 over a governorâ€™s veto. This law enables people to carry concealed weapons without first obtaining a concealed carry license, passing a background check, or completing a firearms safety course.

Missouri law doesnâ€™t state a minimum age for possessing a firearm. It prohibits transferring a firearm to a minor (under 18 years old) without the consent of the custodial parent or legal guardian. Exceptions apply for those in the Armed Forces or National Guard while on duty.

Under federal law, a licensed dealer cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21 years old or a long gun to anyone under 18 years old, with limited exceptions. Missouri law likewise outlaws providing a concealable firearm to a minor.

In 2021, the Missouri General Assembly passed the Second Amendment Preservation Act. This law, signed by Governor Mike Parson, stated that Missouri would not enforce or assist in the enforcement of federal gun laws it viewed as infringements on the Second Amendment right to bear arms.

The law was struck down in a federal district court in Missouri as an unconstitutional violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, among other reasons. The Eighth Circuit federal appeals court allowed the lower courtâ€™s order to stand and prevented state enforcement of the law while the case remained pending. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene early in the case, allowing the lower court rulings to stand at this time.

State laws that attempt to limit cooperation with the federal government or with federal law over firearms often confuse state and local law enforcement officers. Missouriâ€™s law provided for the possibility of $50,000 fines against municipalities if local police officers assisted federal law enforcement or cooperated with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

The stateâ€™s appeal of the federal district court ruling remains pending in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for now.

Although Missouri is a permitless carry state, it continues to provide an optional concealed carry permit process for permit holders who seek reciprocity to carry in other states. Missourians can apply for a concealed carry permit with their local sheriff.

Permitless carry laws do not sanction those prohibited from possessing a firearm from carrying one. State and federal prohibitions on who can possess a firearm still apply.

### Location Restrictions for Firearms

Missouri law also contains location restrictions for firearms. Prohibited locations include:

  * Schools, with limited exceptions
  * Universities and colleges
  * Police, sheriff, highway patrol stations and offices
  * Polling places on election day
  * Jails, prisons, and detention facilities
  * Courthouses and courtrooms
  * Meetings of a governing body of a local government or the state General Assembly with an exception for members
  * Licensed establishments that sell liquor on premises for consumption (with limited exceptions)
  * Airports
  * Childcare facilities
  * Riverboat gambling operations open to the public (limited exceptions)
  * Amusement parks
  * Churches and other places of religious worship (limited exceptions)
  * Private property (with posted signage)
  * Certain sports arenas and stadiums
  * Hospitals accessible to the public
  * Locations prohibited under federal law



Although Missouri has a preemption law preventing cities and counties from passing gun laws in conflict with state law, it does allow these entities to prohibit firearms in their local government buildings and offices.
