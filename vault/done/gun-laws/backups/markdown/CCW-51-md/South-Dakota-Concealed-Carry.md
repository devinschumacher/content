### Summary of South Dakota Gun Laws

### General Information

South Dakota is currently a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Permits are processed at the county level by the sheriff‚Äôs office. No permits, firearms registration, or background checks are required to buy a handgun from a private individual.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in South Dakota without a permit. The minimum age is 18 years old. Based on an unofficial 2004 Attorney General Opinion, without a permit, handguns in a vehicle must be in plain sight. Some areas are off-limits, including elementary and secondary schools and school buses.

### Permitless Carry

South Dakota is now a permitless carry state. Anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a concealed carry permit. For reciprocity purposes, the state issues Concealed Pistol Permits (CPP) to residents, as well as members of the military and their spouses stationed in South Dakota. There are three permits available: Regular, Gold Card, and Enhanced.

  1. **Regular Permit** : Allows holders to carry concealed and is recognized in a number of other states.
  2. **Gold Card Permit** : In addition to the benefits of a regular permit, proves passage of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) when purchasing a firearm, resulting in no required waiting period.
  3. **Enhanced Permit** : Requires a firearms training course, provides the purchase background check exemption, and is recognized in seven more states than the regular license.



### Reciprocity

South Dakota recognizes permits issued by all states.

### Defense Laws

#### Defense of Dwelling or Residence ‚Äî Force ‚Äî Deadly Force

A person who is in a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle in which they have a right to be has no duty to retreat, has the right to stand their ground, and has the right to use:

  * Force if they reasonably believe that using force is necessary to defend themselves or another against the imminent use of unlawful force.
  * Deadly force if they reasonably believe that using deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony.



A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm to themselves or another when using or threatening to use defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm if the person against whom the defensive force was used had unlawfully entered or was in the process of unlawfully entering a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle.

#### Deadly Force ‚Äî Defense of Person

A person is justified in using deadly force if they reasonably believe that using deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. There is no duty to retreat and they have the right to stand their ground.

#### Immunity

A person who uses or threatens to use force, as permitted in this statute, is justified and is immune from criminal prosecution and from civil liability for the use or threatened use of such force brought by the person against whom force was used or threatened.

[S.D. Codified Laws ¬ß 22‚Äì18‚Äì4]

#### Force ‚Äî Defense of Property Other Than a Dwelling

A person is justified in using force, other than deadly force, against another if and to the extent they reasonably believe that using force is necessary to prevent or terminate another‚Äôs trespass on, or criminal interference with, real property other than a dwelling. There is no duty to retreat.

#### Deadly Force ‚Äî Defense of Property Other Than a Dwelling

A person is justified in using deadly force only if they reasonably believe that the use of deadly force is necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. There is no duty to retreat and they have the right to stand their ground if they are in a place where they have a right to be.

#### Self-Defense

South Dakota is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. There is no duty to retreat as long as the force used is justified, and the law applies as long as the person is in a place where they have the right to be.

### South Dakota Concealed Carry Permit Renewal Process

### Step 1

The holder of an enhanced permit may renew the permit through the sheriff of the county where the holder resides. The period for renewal begins 180 days before the permit expires and ends 30 days after expiration. Effective February 6, 2024, the renewal period begins twelve months before the permit expires and ends thirty days after expiration. The holder must:

  * Present proof of successfully completing the live fire component of a qualifying handgun course during the renewal period.
  * Provide evidence of receiving instruction regarding the use of force standards and relevant criminal statutory changes.
  * Pay the renewal fee.
  * Pay the fingerprint background check fee.

If the holder does not renew the enhanced permit within 30 days of expiration, they must reapply for a new enhanced permit.

The holder of a gold card permit may renew the permit starting 90 days before it expires and ending 30 days after expiration. Effective July 1, 2021, this period extends to 180 days before expiration. The holder must pay the renewal fee and pass a criminal background check and a check utilizing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

The holder of a regular permit may renew it beginning 90 days prior to expiration. There is a 30-day grace period to renew the permit. During this grace period, the permit holder may continue to carry a concealed pistol. However, law enforcement may issue a warning ticket to notify the permit holder of the expired status. This grace period does not apply to any permit holder who commits a crime that would make it unlawful for them to possess a gun or who attempted to renew the permit but was denied.

Additional firearm training is required if a permit has expired for more than 30 days.
