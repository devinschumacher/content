### Summary of Minnesota Gun Laws

Minnesota operates under a shall-issue policy for handgun permits, where a sheriff may only deny a permit if there is a substantial likelihood of danger to oneself or others. Permits are issued by the Sheriff’s office in the applicant’s county of residence.

Private handgun sales in Minnesota do not require a permit, background check, or firearm registration.

### Concealed and Open Carry

Both concealed and open carry are legal with a Minnesota Permit to Carry a Pistol (PCP) or a permit from a state that Minnesota honors. There is no stipulation requiring the handgun to be concealed.

### Recent Legal Development

On March 31, 2023, a federal judge ruled unconstitutional a Minnesota law that previously required individuals to be at least 21 years old to obtain a permit to carry a handgun in public. Resident and non-resident permits are available, and non-residents may apply at any sheriff’s office.

### Transporting and Reciprocity

No permit is required for transporting a firearm, keeping it at home, or having it in a place of business. Minnesota honors permits from states with similar requirements in terms of reciprocity.

### Justifiable Taking of Life

Under Minnesota law, the intentional taking of another person’s life is legal only when necessary to prevent great bodily harm, death, or the commission of a felony.

### Self-Defense

Minnesota imposes a duty to retreat, meaning deadly force is justified only as a last resort when a person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent great bodily harm, death, or the commission of a felony. While Minnesota does not have a Castle Doctrine law, it recognizes similar principles.

### Authorized Use of Force

Reasonable force is permissible under Minnesota law in various circumstances, including resisting an offense against oneself or others, defending property from trespass or interference, and in lawful authority roles such as parents, teachers, or school employees ensuring safety.

[Minn. Stat. §§ 609.06 & 609.065]

### Handgun Purchase Process

To buy or transfer ownership of a firearm in Minnesota, you must have a Minnesota Permit to Carry a Pistol or a Permit to Purchase/Transfer a Firearm. The application for a Permit to Purchase/Transfer a Firearm must be submitted in person to your local police chief or county sheriff’s office. You must also present your Minnesota driver’s license or state-issued photo ID. After your application has been submitted, your local police chief or county sheriff’s office will run a background check. Generally this process takes 7 days to complete. Upon clearing the background check, you will be issued a Permit to Purchase/Transfer a Firearm through the mail, which will be valid for 1 year from the date it is issued. For single-purchase transactions, many gun shops in the state will allow you to apply for a permit to purchase directly at the store. You will still be required to pass a background check before making a purchase. A gun shop may charge for this service. Not every gun shop in the state will process permit applications, per their own discretion.
