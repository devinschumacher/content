### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Oklahoma without a license for individuals who are at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for members or veterans of the U.S. military). This is permitted for self-defense, hunting, fishing, educational, or recreational purposes. Certain locations, such as public government buildings, are restricted.

### Permitless Carry

Oklahoma allows permitless carry for individuals who are at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for military members or honorably discharged veterans) and legally eligible to own a firearm. This allows both open and concealed carry without a license. However, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation issues Self-Defense Act Licenses (SDAL) to residents and eligible military personnel stationed in Oklahoma. Applicants must be 21 or older, complete a firearms course, and meet other criteria. Non-residents are not eligible for these licenses. Oklahoma recognizes permits issued by all other states and allows residents of other permitless carry states to carry within its borders.

### Immunity and Self-Defense

Under Oklahoma law, individuals using justified defensive force are immune from both criminal prosecution and civil liability. Oklahoma upholds the Castle Doctrine and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù principles, meaning there is no obligation to retreat in any place where one has a legal right to be. Individuals have the right to defend themselves with force, including deadly force, if they believe it is necessary to prevent death, great bodily harm, or the commission of a forcible felony.

For specific definitions and further details, refer to Oklahoma state statutes.
