### Summary of Illinois Gun Laws

Illinois is a shall-issue state, meaning the Illinois State Police must issue a concealed carry license if the applicant meets certain qualifications. However, law enforcement can object to an applicant if they believe the applicant is a danger to public safety or themselves. Such cases are reviewed by the Concealed Carry Licensing Review Board, which makes the final decision. Applicants are notified by mail, and there is an appeal process.

Open carry of a handgun on your person or in a vehicle is illegal.

An Illinois Concealed Carry License (CCL) is required to carry a concealed firearm in Illinois. Applicants must be 21 or older and complete a 16-hour firearms training course conducted by a state-approved instructor. The license permits carrying a loaded or unloaded handgun concealed from public view or within a vehicle. Non-resident licenses are only available for residents of Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas, and Virginia. Illinois does not honor concealed carry licenses from any other state.

Illinois residents must have a Firearm Owners Identification Card (FOID) to possess a firearm or ammunition. FOID card holders without a CCL can carry unloaded firearms enclosed in a case. You must be 21 years old to apply for a FOID card, or have a parent or guardian sponsor who is eligible for a FOID card.

### COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustments

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FOID card holders and CCL licensees who submit renewal applications will remain valid during the state‚Äôs disaster proclamation and for 18 months following its termination. This applies even if their renewal application was not submitted before expiration. A FOID card or CCL that expired during the pandemic is still considered valid if the holder applied for renewal, paid the required fees, and the card is not subject to revocation. Additionally, CCL licensees do not need to immediately submit proof of three-hour training with their renewal application but must submit proof within 18 months following the end of the disaster proclamation.

### Self-Defense

Illinois is a Castle Doctrine state. There is no legal duty to retreat if threatened, and using deadly force is justified.

### Use of Force in Defense of Person

A person is justified in using force when they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or another against imminent unlawful force. Deadly force is justified only if it is necessary to prevent imminent death, great bodily harm, or the commission of a forcible felony.

### Use of Force in Defense of Other Property

A person can use force to prevent or terminate another‚Äôs trespass or criminal interference with real or personal property. Deadly force is justified only to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

### Liability

Acts involving justified use of force do not give rise to liability unless the force used involves willful or wanton misconduct.

### Use of Force in Defense of Dwelling

A person can use force to prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or attack on a dwelling. Deadly force is justified if:

  * The entry is violent, and the person believes it necessary to prevent an assault or offer of personal violence.
  * The person believes it necessary to prevent the commission of a felony in the dwelling.



### Assault Weapons Ban

On January 10, 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker signed HB 5471, the Protect Illinois Communities Act, into law. This law makes it illegal to deliver, sell, purchase, or possess assault weapons, assault weapon attachments, .50 caliber rifles, or .50 caliber cartridges. Possession of such weapons is illegal 300 days after the law‚Äôs effective date, except for weapons registered with the Illinois State Police within the specified time.

### Non-Resident Permitting

**Does Illinois issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?**

### Preemption

**Does Illinois have preemption laws related to concealed carry?**

Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Illinois. The regulation, licensing, possession, registration, and transportation of handguns and ammunition for handguns by concealed handgun licensees are exclusive powers and functions of the State. Any ordinance or regulation that purports to impose regulations or restrictions on licensees or handguns and ammunition for handguns shall be invalid in its application to licensees. Local municipalities can regulate individuals who do not possess a valid FOID card or CCL, firearms other than handguns, and matters related to the sale, purchase, and storage of all firearms.

Any violation constitutes a misdemeanor, may trigger license suspension or revocation, as well as a fine.

Based on the passage of HB 562 (2021), the following process will be implemented as of January 1, 2022:

  * The Illinois State Police will create a combined FOID and CCL, offering cardholders the ability to apply for renewal 6 months before the expiration date, and will update FOID and CCL renewal dates to be the same for one cardholder.
  * Beginning January 1, 2022, if the FOID expires during the term of the licensee‚Äôs CCL, the FOID and the license remain valid during the validity of the CCL. The licensee does not have to renew his or her FOID if it has not been otherwise renewed as provided in this Act. Unless the Illinois State Police has reason to believe the licensee is no longer eligible for the card, the Illinois State Police may automatically renew the licensee‚Äôs FOID.

  * Renewals: $150 ($300 for non-residents)

Currently, the only states considered to be substantially similar are Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas, and Virginia. The application process is the same as for residents.

### Name/Address Changes:

Illinois issues licenses to residents and select non-residents. Residents are required to obtain a Firearm Owner‚Äôs Identification (FOID) card to apply for a license. Non-residents are not required to have a FOID provided they have a valid concealed carry permit issued in their home state. Any new resident who is not otherwise prohibited from possessing or using a firearm is not required to have a FOID card to possess firearms or firearms ammunition until 60 calendar days after he or she obtains an Illinois driver‚Äôs license or Illinois ID Card.

Include a note that you have moved out of state and are surrendering your FOID/CCL.
