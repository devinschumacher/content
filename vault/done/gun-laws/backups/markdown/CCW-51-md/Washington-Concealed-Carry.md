### Open Carry and Restrictions

Open carry without a license is legal for those 21 and older, but prohibited in certain places like schools and courthouses.

A valid permit is required to carry a loaded handgun in any vehicle.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Residents with a Washington Concealed Pistol License (CPL) and non-residents with recognized permits can legally carry concealed. CPLs are available to those 21 and older without mandatory firearms training. Exceptions for carrying without a license include one‚Äôs home or business.

### Self-Defense and Use of Force

Washington lacks a specific castle law but permits self-defense without a duty to retreat when lawfully present and under threat. Use of force is justified to prevent offenses or detain intruders on one‚Äôs property, provided it‚Äôs proportionate to the threat.

### Justifiable Homicide and Defending Against Violent Crime

Homicide is justifiable in defense against imminent felony or danger to persons in a dwelling. Washington law protects individuals using reasonable force to defend themselves, family, or property against violent crimes without legal jeopardy.
