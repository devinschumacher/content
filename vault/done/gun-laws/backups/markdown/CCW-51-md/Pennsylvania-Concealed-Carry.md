### Summary of Pennsylvania Gun Laws

Pennsylvania operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons licenses, issued at the county level by the sheriff‚Äôs office or, for residents of cities of the first class, by the chief of police.

### Firearm Purchase and Registration

No permit is required for purchasing firearms in Pennsylvania, and there is no comprehensive firearms registration system. However, the state police maintain a database of all handgun buyers. Private-party transfers of handguns must be conducted through a licensed dealer or at a county sheriff‚Äôs office, with a mandatory background check. Exceptions include transfers between spouses, parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Pennsylvania for individuals 18 or older who are legally allowed to possess a firearm. A significant court decision (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Darren Montgomery, 234 A.3d 523 (PA 2020)) has created ambiguity regarding the definition of open carry. To open or conceal carry in a vehicle or to open carry in Philadelphia, individuals need a Pennsylvania License to Carry Firearms (LCF) or a permit from a reciprocal state.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry is lawful for residents with an LCF and for non-residents with a license/permit recognized by Pennsylvania. The state issues LCFs to residents and non-residents aged 21 and older (a recent court ruling found restrictions on 18‚Äì20 year olds unconstitutional). Non-residents must possess a valid carry permit from their home state. Pennsylvania does not mandate training for obtaining an LCF and only honors resident CCW licenses from states with reciprocity agreements.

### Self-Defense Laws

Pennsylvania adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law, permitting individuals to use force in self-defense without a duty to retreat in their residence or any place they legally occupy. Use of force is justified when protecting against unlawful force, including scenarios involving deadly weapons. Deadly force is justifiable to prevent death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, or sexual assault, under specific conditions outlined in state statutes.

### Use of Force for Property Protection

The use of force is justified to prevent unlawful entry or trespass on land or to reclaim movable property. Pennsylvania law permits defensive actions when an actor believes such force is immediately necessary.

[18 Pa. Cons. Stat, ¬ß¬ß 505, 506 & 507]

This has been reinforced by the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas decision against the City of Pittsburgh in Anderson v. City of Pittsburgh. The court found that Pittsburgh‚Äôs attempt to impose local gun control measures was a clear violation of state preemption law. [18 Pa. Cons. Stat. ¬ß 6120]
