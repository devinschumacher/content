# Rhode Island Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Rhode Island Gun Laws

Rhode Island is a shall-issue state by state law, but the attorney general may issue licenses as well. Licenses to carry concealed weapons are issued at the local level by the police chief or by the attorney general.

Under Rhode Island law, local law enforcement shall issue licenses to eligible applicants if it appears that the applicant is a suitable person to be licensed and either has good reason to fear an injury to their person or property or has any other proper reason for carrying a handgun.

The Rhode Island attorney general also may issue a license to carry a handgun, concealed or not, to a person age 21 or older who makes a proper showing of need for the license and has certification of their ability to use the handgun. The attorney-general-issued license, unlike that issued by local authorities, can also be granted to undocumented persons.

In order to purchase a handgun, a buyer must have a Rhode Island License to Carry Concealed Weapons (LCCW) or obtain a "blue card" from the RI Department of Environmental Management. A background check is required to buy a handgun from a private individual. The background check is obtained through the state police or local chief of police. Firearms registration is not required in Rhode Island.

Open carry is only legal in Rhode Island with a Rhode Island LCCW issued by the attorney general. LCCWs issued by local authorities are for concealed carry only. Concealed carry is also legal only with a Rhode Island LCCW. Applicants can obtain a concealed handgun license by applying either to local licensing authorities or to the attorney general. The processes for each are similar. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and are required to explain why they need a firearm and how it will remedy their problem and must provide three notarized references. A firearms training course that includes a live-firing test is required. Non-residents who have a permit from their home state may apply for a LCCW through local law enforcement. The attorney general may issue LCCWs to non-residents without permits from their home state. Some areas are off-limits even with a LCCW, including state parks and federal buildings. Rhode Island does not honor permits from any other states.

## Self-Defense

Rhode Island is a Castle Doctrine state. Rhode Island law states the owner, tenant, or occupier of a place has no duty to retreat and can engage a threat with reasonable means of self-defense.

It is presumed as a matter of law in any civil or criminal proceeding that the owner, tenant, or occupier of a place where a criminal offense was committed acted by reasonable means in self-defense and in the reasonable belief that the person engaged in the criminal offense was about to inflict great bodily harm or death upon that person or any other individual lawfully in the place where the criminal offense was committed. There shall be no duty on the part of an owner, tenant, or occupier to retreat from any person engaged in the commission of any criminal offense enumerated in Â§Â§ 11-8-2 â€“ 11-8-6, which includes:

*   Breaking or entering a dwelling house, apartment, building, or garage.
*   Intent to commit murder, sexual assault, robbery, arson, or larceny.

\[R.I. Gen. Laws Ann. Â§ 11-8-8\]

## Handgun Purchase Process

To purchase a handgun in Rhode Island, you must first possess a Rhode Island Hunter Education Course Card (also known as an Orange Card) or Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) Pistol/Revolver Safety Certificate (also known as a Blue Card). A Blue Card certifies that you have completed the stateâ€™s required handgun safety exam. The 50-question exam, which contains both true/false and multiple-choice questions, can be completed at any RIDEM-approved firearms dealer or sporting club in the state or at the RIDEM Headquarters in Providence. There is no fee to take the exam. A study booklet can be obtained by calling the RIDEM Division of Fish and Wildlife at (401) 789-0281 or emailing them at DEM.DFW@dem.ri.gov. To pass, you must score at least 80 percent. After achieving a passing score, your Blue Card will arrive by mail.

Active military personnel may waive the handgun safety exam requirement and obtain a Blue Card by presenting their Military ID at either the RIDEM Division of Fish & Wildlife Great Swamp Field Headquarters or RIDEM Headquarters at 235 Promenade Street, Providence, Rhode Island.

When purchasing your handgun, whether through a private transaction or through a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), you will need to complete a Purchase of a Pistol or Revolver Application Form. There is a 7-day waiting period after filing this form with the State Police, during which a background check is completed. If you are approved, you may pick up your firearm after the waiting period has passed.
