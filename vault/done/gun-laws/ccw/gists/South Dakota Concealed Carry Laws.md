# South Carolina Concealed Carry Laws

## Â Summary of South Dakota Gun Laws

South Dakota operates under a shall-issue, permitless carry system. Permits are issued by county sheriffs, but are not required for handgun purchases from private individuals, nor for open carry, which is legal statewide from the age of 18.

### Permitless Carry

South Dakota allows permitless concealed carry for individuals who are at least 18 years old and legally eligible to possess a firearm. However, the state also issues Concealed Pistol Permits (CPP) for reciprocity purposes.

### Types of Permits

*   **Regular Permit:**Â Allows concealed carry and is recognized in multiple states.
*   **Gold Card Permit:**Â Includes NICS background check exemption for firearm purchases, eliminating waiting periods.
*   **Enhanced Permit:**Â Requires firearms training and is recognized in more states than the regular permit.

### Reciprocity

South Dakota honors concealed carry permits issued by all states.

### Self-Defense Laws

South Dakotaâ€™s self-defense laws include:

*   **Defense of Dwelling or Residence:**Â No duty to retreat if threatened in one's home or vehicle. Deadly force is justifiable to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.
*   **Defense of Person:**Â Justified use of deadly force against imminent death, great bodily harm, or to prevent a forcible felony.
*   **Immunity:**Â Individuals using justified force are immune from criminal prosecution and civil liability.

### Defense of Property

*   **Non-Dwelling Property:**Â Justified use of force, but not deadly force, against trespass or criminal interference.
*   **Deadly Force for Property:**Â Justifiable only to prevent imminent forcible felonies.

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

South Dakota applies Castle Doctrine principles, allowing individuals to defend themselves without a duty to retreat if justified. This applies wherever the person has a legal right to be.
