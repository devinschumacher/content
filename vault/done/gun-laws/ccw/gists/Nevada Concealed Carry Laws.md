# Nevada Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Nevada Gun Laws

Nevada operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, issued at the county level.

  

### Private Sales and Registration

No permit or firearms registration is required for purchasing handguns from private individuals in Nevada. Since January 2, 2020, all sales must be processed through a licensed federal firearms dealer with a background check, excluding temporary transfers and transfers between immediate family members.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal throughout Nevada without a permit for anyone 18 years or older who can legally possess a firearm. Firearms can be openly carried in most places except where specifically prohibited, such as on school premises and areas where legislative business is conducted. Open carry is allowed in more places compared to concealed carry.

### Concealed Carry Permits

Residents and non-residents with recognized out-of-state permits can legally carry concealed firearms in Nevada. Applicants must be 21 years old (18 for military), complete an approved firearm safety course, and demonstrate handgun proficiency. Certain areas like school premises and public airports are off-limits for concealed carry.

### Reciprocity and Restrictions

Nevada recognizes permits from other states that meet specific criteria, which are listed on the state's official website.

  

### Self-Defense Laws

#### Resistance and Justifiable Homicide

*   **Resistance by Party About to Be Injured:** Individuals may resist an offense against themselves, their family, or their property.
*   **Resistance by Other Persons:** Others may intervene to prevent harm to someone else.

#### Justifiable Homicide

Homicide is justified in self-defense, defense of an occupied habitation, or defense of a person against a violent crime. This applies when the defender is not the aggressor, has a lawful right to be present, and is not engaged in criminal activity.

*   **‚ÄúCrime of Violence‚Äù Definition:** Any felony involving substantial risk of force or violence against persons or property.

#### Self-Defense and Immunity

Nevada supports the Castle Doctrine and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù principles. There is no duty to retreat within one‚Äôs home or workplace. Force used in self-defense must be immediate, in good faith, and proportionate to the threat posed by the aggressor.

*   **Immunity from Civil Liability:** Use of force likely to cause injury or death is immune from civil liability if justified under Nevada law.

\[Nev. Rev. Stat. ¬ß¬ß 193.240, 193.250, 200.120, and 41.095\]
