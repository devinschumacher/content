# South Carolina Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of South Carolina Gun Laws

South Carolina is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with concealed weapons permits issued at the state level by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

As of March 7th, 2024, open carry as well as concealed carry is legal without a permit to anyone 18 years of age or older who is not prohibited by law. A "concealable weapon" means a firearm having a length of less than 12 inches carried openly on one’s person or in a manner that is hidden from public view in normal wear of clothing except when needed for self-defense, defense of others, and the protection of real or personal property. Areas that are off-limits to concealed carry are also off-limits to open carry. In addition, private properties posted with signs stating 'No Concealable Weapons Allowed' prohibit both open and concealed carry.

CWPs are issued to residents, non-residents who own property in the state, and military personnel stationed in South Carolina. Concealed carry permits require an 8-hour firearms training course that has been approved by the state. The minimum age to obtain a CWP is now 18 years old. In terms of reciprocity, South Carolina honors resident permits from states that recognize South Carolina permits, provided that the reciprocal state requires an applicant to successfully pass a criminal background check and a course in firearm training and safety. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and courthouses.

## Self-Defense

South Carolina is a Castle Doctrine state. A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in a place where they have a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground.

A person is presumed to have a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily injury to themselves or another person when using deadly force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily injury to another person if the person:

*   Against whom the deadly force is used is in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering, has unlawfully and forcibly entered a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle, or if they remove or are attempting to remove another person against their will from the dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle; and
*   Who uses deadly force knows or has reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act is occurring or has occurred.

A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in another place where they have a right to be, including but not limited to their place of business, has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury to themselves or another person or to prevent the commission of a violent crime.

"**Dwelling**" means a building or conveyance of any kind, including an attached porch, whether the building or conveyance is temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile, which has a roof over it, including a tent, and is designed to be occupied by people lodging there at night.

"**Residence**" means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as an invited guest.

"**Vehicle**" means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, which is designed to transport people or property.
