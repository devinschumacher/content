# Wisconsin Concealed Carry Laws

##  Summary of Wisconsin Gun Laws

Wisconsin is a shall-issue state with concealed carry weapons (CCW) licenses issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ). There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry is legal for any person who is 18 years or older and not prohibited from possessing a firearm under state and federal laws.

Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License (CWL) and for non-residents with a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors. CWLs are issued to residents and military personnel stationed in Wisconsin. Applicants must be 21 or older, have completed a firearms training course, and meet other criteria. Wisconsin will honor permits from states with reciprocity agreements or those that require a comparable background check.

## Defense of Property and Protection Against Retail Theft

A person may threaten or intentionally use force to prevent or terminate what they reasonably believe to be an unlawful interference with their property. Only the degree of force believed necessary to prevent or terminate the interference is permissible. Deadly force is not reasonable solely for the defense of property.

A person may defend a third person’s property from unlawful interference under the same conditions and means as defending their own property, provided they reasonably believe that the third person would be privileged to defend their own property. The third person must be a member of the defender’s immediate family or household, someone whose property they have a legal duty to protect, or a merchant with the defender as their employee or agent. Library employees or agents may also defend library property in this manner.

## Self-Defense

Wisconsin follows the Castle Doctrine, meaning there is no duty to retreat, and the law applies to a person’s residence, vehicle, or business.

### Self-Defense and Defense of Others

A person may threaten or use force against another if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate interference. Deadly force may only be used if the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves.

A person may defend a third person from unlawful interference under the same conditions as defending themselves, provided they reasonably believe that the third person would be privileged to act in self-defense and that intervention is necessary for the third person’s protection.

If deadly force is used, the court may not consider whether the actor had an opportunity to flee or retreat before using force. The court shall presume the actor reasonably believed that force was necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm if:

*   The person against whom the force was used was unlawfully and forcibly entering the actor’s dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business; the actor was present; and the actor knew or reasonably believed that an unlawful and forcible entry was occurring.
*   The person against whom the force was used was in the actor’s dwelling, motor vehicle, or place of business after unlawfully and forcibly entering; the actor was present; and the actor knew or reasonably believed that an unlawful and forcible entry had occurred.

### Definition of "Dwelling"

A "dwelling" includes any premises used as a home or residence and the lot or site devoted to residential use. It also includes structures on the immediate residential premises, such as driveways, sidewalks, swimming pools, terraces, patios, fences, porches, garages, and basements.

### Weapons Other Than Handguns Allowed?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry weapons other than handguns in Wisconsin with a concealed carry license (or under permitless carry if applicable)?

**Answer:** Yes. "Weapon" means a handgun, an electric weapon, or a billy club. "Electric weapon" means any device designed or used to immobilize or incapacitate persons by the use of electric current.

**Question:** Is it legal to own a taser or stun gun in Wisconsin?

**Answer:** Yes. A concealed carry license is required to carry a stun gun or Taser, except in an individual’s dwelling, place of business, or on land that he or she owns, leases, or legally occupies. The minimum age for possession is 18 years old. Transporting a stun gun is allowed without a license if the stun gun is enclosed within a carrying case. It is illegal to carry or use a stun gun on school premises.

### Chemical Spray/Pepper Spray?

**Question:** Is it legal to buy or use chemical spray/pepper spray in Wisconsin?

**Answer:** Yes, any non-felon at least 18 years old or minors with permission from a parent or guardian, may purchase or possess a device or container that contains a combination of oleoresin of capsicum or CS gel and inert ingredients but does not contain any other gas or substance that will cause bodily discomfort when acting in self-defense or defense of another.

### Open Carry Permitted?

**Question:** Is open carry permitted in Wisconsin?

**Answer:** Any business may prohibit individuals from entering the premises with a firearm if the property is posted or verbal notice is given, though weapons can be stored in vehicles in parking areas. The individual hotel should be contacted to inquire about its concealed carry policy. Handguns are prohibited from hotel taverns for anyone without a concealed carry license, provided the licensee does not consume alcohol.

### Store in a Vehicle in an Employee Parking Lot?

**Question:** Does Wisconsin have laws relating to storing firearms in private vehicles in an employee parking lot?

**Answer:** An employer may not prohibit a licensee, as a condition of employment, from carrying or storing a concealed weapon, a particular type of concealed weapon, or ammunition in the licensee’s own motor vehicle, regardless of whether the motor vehicle is used in the course of employment or whether the motor vehicle is driven or parked on property used by the employer.

### Carry in Vehicle?

**Question:** Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in Wisconsin?

**Answer:** Yes, with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, but not in or on the grounds of a school. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled on 4/10/18 that a person must have a license that is valid in Wisconsin to carry a concealed loaded handgun within reach in a vehicle. Without a license, a loaded handgun must not be concealed in any manner, including on a car seat. Based on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruling in State v. Walls (1994), in order to be considered openly carried in a vehicle, the handgun must be discernible from the ordinary observation of a person located outside and within the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. Some interpret this to mean above the window line of the vehicle.

##  Key State Laws

### Brandishing

**Does Wisconsin state law define brandishing?**

No definition of brandishing was found in Wisconsin law. However, anyone who endangers another's safety by the negligent operation or handling of a dangerous weapon, or intentionally points a firearm at or toward another shall be charged.

Wis. Stat. § 941.20

Whoever, in a public or private place, engages in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud or otherwise disorderly conduct under circumstances in which the conduct tends to cause or provoke a disturbance shall be charged.

Wis. Stat. § 947.01

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Controlled Substances

**Does Wisconsin have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or controlled substances?**

Not while consuming or under the influence or while the person has a detectable amount of a restricted controlled substance in his or her blood. Under the influence of an intoxicant means that the actor's ability to operate a vehicle or handle a firearm or airgun is materially impaired because of his or her consumption of an alcohol beverage, hazardous inhalant, a controlled substance, controlled substance analog, or any combination of those things.

Wis. Stat. §§ 941.20, 941.237, and 939.22(42)

As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### Non-Resident Permitting

**Does Wisconsin issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?**

Yes, but only issued to military personnel stationed in Wisconsin.

### Public Access to Concealed Carry Registry

**Does Wisconsin allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?**

No. Wisconsin concealed carry data is not public record.

### "No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced

**Are "No Weapons Allowed" signs enforced in Wisconsin?**

Yes. Whoever enters or remains in any of the following areas once notified not to enter or remain while carrying a firearm is subject to a Class B forfeiture:

*   A residence
*   A common area in a building or on the grounds of a residence that is not a single-family residence
*   Any part of a nonresidential building, grounds or land (not including state or local government properties, buildings on the grounds or grounds of a university or college)
*   A special event
*   Any part of a building that is owned, occupied or controlled by the state or any local governmental unit, excluding any building or portion of a building under §175.60 (16) (a) (not including leased residential or business premises)
*   In any privately or publicly owned building or on the grounds of a university or college (not including leased residential or business premises in the buildings)

These restrictions do not apply to firearms that are in vehicles driven or parked in parking facilities on these properties.

Wis. Stat. § 943.13

### Red Flag Law

**Does Wisconsin have a red flag law?**

Wisconsin does not have a red flag law.

### Duty to Inform Officer You're Carrying

**Do you have a duty to inform a police officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Wisconsin?**

There is no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm unless the officer asks.

Wis. Stat. § 175.6(2g)(c)

### Driver's License Linked to Carry License

**Is my Wisconsin driver’s license linked to my Wisconsin carry license?**

No. Your Wisconsin driver’s license is not linked to your Wisconsin concealed weapons license. Therefore, a law enforcement officer (LEO) will not be notified that you are a concealed carry license holder immediately when they run your driver’s license. However, LEOs may have access to other databases where they can obtain this information.

### Preemption

**Does Wisconsin have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e. Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?**

Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Wisconsin, except cities may restrict the discharge of firearms (except for self-defense).

Wis. Stat. § 66.0409

##  Handgun Purchase & Possession FAQs

## FAQ: Wisconsin Concealed Carry Questions

## Carry While Gun Hunting?

**Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in Wisconsin?**

Yes, with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, except when shining. In addition, a person who owns, leases or is the legal occupant of land and who is at least age 18, will be allowed to possess a concealed handgun while hunting on those lands without the need for a license to carry a concealed weapon. To use the concealed handgun for hunting purposes, the handgun must be a legal size and caliber for the species being hunted.

## Carry While Bow Hunting?

**Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in Wisconsin?**

Yes. Individuals with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, or qualified former law enforcement officers may possess the type of firearm they qualified with and which is indicated on their certification card, may concealed carry in a wildlife refuge, a Wisconsin state park or state fish hatchery. However, this does not allow such persons to hunt or discharge their firearm in the refuge, state park or state fish hatchery, nor does it allow bringing the firearm inside state-owned buildings on these properties which are posted with signs that provide notice that firearms are not allowed in the building. In addition, a person who owns, leases or is the legal occupant of land and who is at least age 18, will be allowed to possess a concealed handgun while hunting on those lands without the need for a license to carry a concealed weapon.

## Hunter Harassment Law?

**Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in Wisconsin?**

Yes. No person may interfere or attempt to interfere with lawful hunting, fishing, or trapping with the intent to prevent the taking of a wild animal, or intentionally interfere with or intentionally attempt to interfere with an activity associated with lawful hunting, fishing, or trapping.

## What Are The Knife Laws In Wisconsin?

**What are the knife laws in Wisconsin?**

Knives are not listed as dangerous weapons in Wisconsin, so knives may be carried openly or concealed. Anyone who is prohibited from possessing a firearm is prohibited from carrying a concealed knife. Knives are prohibited at K-12 schools, which includes buildings and grounds, athletic fields, recreation areas, and any other property used or operated for school administration. Local governments may also restrict the possession of knives at government facilities.

## Wear A COVID Mask & Carry?

**I can legally carry a concealed firearm in Wisconsin, but can I wear a COVID-19 protective mask while carrying concealed?**

One statute was identified in Wisconsin, which refers to individuals concealing their identity with the intention to commit illegal acts or to specifically hide their identity. It does not address wearing a mask while legally carrying a concealed firearm. In addition, Deputy City Attorney Marci Paulson stated she doesn’t know of any statutory or regulatory prohibition that would affect a concealed carry license while complying with the order to wear a mask.
