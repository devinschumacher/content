# New York Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of New York Gun Laws

New York is now a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on NYSRPA v Bruen on June 23, 2022. Concealed weapons licenses are issued locally by the county sheriff or court system.

A permit to purchase, a background check, and firearms registration are required to buy a handgun from a private individual in New York. Private sales must be processed by a licensed firearms dealer. It is illegal to possess an unregistered handgun.

Open carry is not addressed in New York state law, but a New York Pistol License (NYPL) is required to possess a loaded handgun outside of the home or place of business.

Concealed carry is only legal with a NYPL. The minimum age is 21, except for honorably discharged military members, who can be any age. The application process may vary depending on the type of license and the issuing county. New York does not recognize permits or licenses from any other states. Only residents, part-time residents, or those principally employed or with a principal place of business in New York can obtain NYPLs. Pistol licenses from New York City are valid statewide, but a NYPL is not valid in the five counties of New York City unless New York City has validated the license. Some areas, such as schools and courthouses, are off-limits. There are several types of NYPLs available, with the most common being the concealed carry and possess on premises licenses. Both licenses can have restrictions, such as only being valid during hunting or traveling to or from target practice. New York does not honor permits from any other states.

## Self-Defense

New York's self-defense law is based on the Castle Doctrine. In New York, citizens have a duty to retreat from attackers if they can do so safely.

### Use of Physical Force

A person may use physical force in self-defense, defense of a third person, defense of premises, or to prevent larceny or criminal mischief to property. A person may use physical force when they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a crime involving damage to premises or to prevent or terminate a criminal trespass, larceny, or criminal mischief with respect to property. Any degree of physical force other than deadly physical force can be used.

### Use of Deadly Force

Deadly force can only be used if the person reasonably believes that:

*   Another person is using or about to use deadly physical force. However, the person may not use deadly physical force if they can retreat with complete personal safety, except there is no duty to retreat if they are in their dwelling and are not the initial aggressor.
*   Another person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible criminal sexual act, or robbery.
*   Another person is committing or attempting to commit arson or burglary, and the circumstances are such that the use of deadly physical force is authorized.

## Carry Locations FAQs

### Carry In Vehicle?

**Question:** Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in New York?

**Answer:** Yes, based upon the terms of a NYPL only. It is legal to transport a legal firearm through New York under Federal interstate transportation law 18 USC ¬ß 926A, provided the handgun is unloaded, with neither the firearm nor any ammunition readily accessible from the passenger compartment. In the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver‚Äôs compartment, the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console. If you don't have a NYPL and happen to stop at a motel overnight, you are in violation of the law and subject to arrest if found with a firearm.

Although a state license to carry a handgun is generally invalid in New York City, a license is valid if the firearm covered by the license:

*   Has been purchased from a licensed dealer within the city of New York and is being transported out of the city immediately from the dealer by the licensee in a locked container during a continuous and uninterrupted trip; or
*   Is being transported by the licensee in a locked container and the trip through the city of New York is continuous and uninterrupted.

## Key State Laws FAQs

### Duty To Inform Officer You're Carrying?

**Question:** Do you have a duty to inform a police officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in New York?

**Answer:** There is no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in New York unless the officer asks.

### Driver's License Linked To Carry License?

**Question:** Is my New York driver‚Äôs license linked to my New York carry license?

**Answer:** No. Your New York driver‚Äôs license is not linked to your New York pistol license. Therefore, a law enforcement officer (LEO) will not be notified that you are a concealed carry license holder immediately when they run your driver‚Äôs license. However, LEOs may have access to other databases where they can obtain this information.

### "No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced?

**Question:** Are "No Weapons Allowed" signs enforced in New York? If yes, violating the sign would be considered a crime. If no, violating the sign would not be considered a criminal offense.

**Answer:** No. However, on July 1, 2022, Gov. Hochul signed legislation that made "no carry" the default for private property unless deemed permissible by property owners. Property owners who do decide to allow concealed carry will have to post signage saying concealed carry is allowed on the premises. According to Section 265.01-D, an individual is guilty of criminal possession if he or she enters into or remains on or in private property where the owner or lessee does not have clear and conspicuous signage indicating that carrying firearms is permitted.

### Preemption?

**Question:** Does New York have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?

**Answer:** Yes. There is partial preemption primarily for handgun licensing. New York laws confer power upon local governments to adopt laws that relate to, among other things, the ‚Äúprotection, order, conduct, safety, health and well-being of persons or property.‚Äù However, local laws may not conflict with the state constitution or general laws.

### Red Flag Law?

**Question:** Does New York have a red flag law?

**Answer:** Yes. New York has a red flag law that allows police, district attorneys, family or household members, and school administrators or their designees to petition a court to have an order of protection issued to a person to remove their firearms, suspend any firearm license, and prevent them from purchasing, possessing, or attempting to purchase or possess a firearm, rifle, or shotgun.

### Brandishing?

**Question:** Does New York state law define brandishing?

**Answer:** No definition of brandishing was found in New York law. However, a person is guilty of menacing in the second degree when he or she intentionally places or attempts to place another person in reasonable fear of physical injury, serious physical injury, or death by displaying a deadly weapon, dangerous instrument, or what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm. A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior.

### Carry While Using Alcohol Or Drugs?

**Question:** Does New York have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?

**Answer:** Not addressed in state statutes. However, as a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### Non-Resident Permitting?

**Question:** Does New York issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?

**Answer:** Yes, for part-time New York State residents or anyone who is principally employed or has his or her principal place of business in the state.

### Public Access To Concealed Carry Registry?

**Question:** Does New York allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?

**Answer:** Yes, although gun owners may request that their application information be exempt from public disclosure. However, local and state law enforcement shall have access to such database in the performance of their duties.

### "Assault Weapons" Ban?

**Question:** Does New York have laws regarding semi-automatic rifles?

**Answer:** Yes. An assault weapon is defined as a semi-automatic pistol or rifle that uses a detachable magazine or a semi-automatic shotgun and which has at least one other characteristic listed in the Penal Law, or a revolving, cylinder shotgun. See New York State Penal Law ¬ß 265.00 (22) for additional definitions, including a list of the characteristics that classify as an assault weapon.

## New York Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

## Step 1: Understanding Recertification

Recertification is the responsibility of the licensee. The pistol license recertification provision of the SAFE Act was passed by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor in 2013. Its goal is to strengthen and improve the accuracy of record-keeping at both the state and local levels. Letters were sent to license holders over a year ago, reminding them of the January 31, 2018, deadline. Additional reminders have been made public through the press and social media.

The State Police are now working to process all recertifications and update its database. This process is expected to take between 9-12 months, after which, local licensing authorities will be provided with the updated, accurate licensing information. The goal is compliance, so the State Police will not take criminal enforcement action against individuals who have unknowingly failed to recertify. They will continue to accept recertifications throughout 2018.

If you currently have a New York City, Nassau County, Suffolk County, or Westchester County license, you must follow the requirements that are in place in your county, rather than use the New York State recertification system.

## Step 2: Recertification Process

Recertification can only be done online. Paper forms are no longer accepted.

## Step 3: Updating Your Information

Complete the online form with your updated contact information.
