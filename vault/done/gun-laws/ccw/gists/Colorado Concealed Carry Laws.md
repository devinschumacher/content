# Colorado Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Colorado Gun Laws

Colorado is a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, issued by local sheriff’s offices to county residents. No purchase permits or firearms registration are required for handguns. Private-party transfers require a background check by a licensed dealer and approval from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

## Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Colorado for individuals 18 years or older who can legally possess a firearm, except in Denver county and other posted areas. Local governments may restrict open carry in specific areas if properly posted.

## Concealed Carry Laws

Residents aged 21 or older, not prohibited from possessing firearms, may obtain a Colorado Concealed Carry Weapon (CCW) permit. Non-residents with a valid CCW from a state recognized by Colorado can also carry concealed. Permits require state-approved firearms training.

## Self-Defense Laws

Colorado follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing residents to expect safety in their homes without a duty to retreat. While not explicitly a stand your ground state, Colorado law permits non-aggressors to defend themselves without retreating.

## Use of Force in Defense

*   **Defense of Property:** Reasonable force can be used to prevent theft or criminal mischief. Deadly force is justified only in defense against threats to life.
*   **Defense of Persons:** Reasonable force is allowed to defend against imminent unlawful force. Deadly force is permissible if necessary to prevent death or serious injury.
*   **Defense Against Intruders:** Deadly force is justified against someone unlawfully entering a dwelling and committing or intending to commit a crime, if there’s reasonable belief of harm.

## Immunity

Occupants using justified force in defense are immune from criminal prosecution and civil liability under Colorado law.

### Handgun Registration

**Question:** Is handgun registration required in Colorado?

**Answer:** No.

  

### Background Checks for Private Gun Sales

**Question:** Are background checks required for private gun sales in Colorado? Are there exceptions?

**Answer:** Yes. Colorado requires a background check on nearly all transfers, requiring both private gun sellers and federally licensed dealers to initiate a background check when transferring a firearm. With few exceptions, any individual seeking to transfer possession of a firearm must have a background check conducted on the prospective transferee by a licensed gun dealer and must obtain approval of the transfer from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) following the background check request. There are exemptions which include sales or transfers to family, transfers to an estate or trust upon the owner’s death, or temporary transfers for self-defense where the unlicensed transferee reasonably believes that possession of the firearm is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury.

### Purchase Permits

**Question:** Is a permit required to purchase a handgun in Colorado?

**Answer:** No.

  

### Minimum Age to Possess and Transport

**Question:** What is the minimum age to possess and transport a handgun in Colorado?

**Answer:** 18 years old, although the following exceptions apply to those under the age of 18 while:

*   In attendance at a hunter's safety course or a firearms safety course.
*   Engaging in legal target shooting.
*   Engaging in certain organized firearm competitions or performances.

*   When at the person’s residence, with the permission of the person’s parent or legal guardian, for the purpose of lawful self-defense.

Any person who intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly provides a handgun with or without payment to any person under the age of 18, or any person who knows of such juvenile's conduct in violation of this law and fails to make reasonable efforts to prevent the violation commits the crime of unlawfully providing a handgun to a juvenile or permitting a juvenile to possess a handgun.

**Question:** Can I possess/carry a handgun in my home without a permit?
