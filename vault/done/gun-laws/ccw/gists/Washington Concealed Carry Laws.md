# Washington Concealed Carry Laws

## Â Summary of Washington Gun Laws

Washington is a shall-issue state, with licenses issued at the local level by the sheriff or police department.

### Private Sales and Registration

Any private sale of firearms in Washington must be conducted through a Federal Firearms Licensed (FFL) dealer, and a background check is required. Retail dealers are required to record and report all retail pistol sales to local police or sheriff and to the State Department of Licensing. For handgun transfers to individuals without a valid Washington driverâ€™s license or state identification card, or who have not been a resident for the previous 90 days, FFLs may not deliver the handgun until the transferee passes a background check or 60 days have elapsed since the request, whichever comes first.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal without a license for anyone at least 21 years old who is legally allowed to possess a firearm. However, there are restrictions on where you can carry, including public schools, state courthouses, the Capitol, state legislative offices, public legislative hearings or meetings, and within 250 feet of permitted demonstrations. A valid permit or license is required to carry a loaded handgun in any vehicle.

### Concealed Carry

Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Washington Concealed Pistol License (CPL) and for non-residents with a license or permit from a state that Washington recognizes. CPLs are issued to individuals who are at least 21 years old. There is no requirement to attend a firearms training course. Concealed carry is prohibited without a license, except in oneâ€™s home or fixed place of business. Washington recognizes permits from other states that meet specific requirements.

## Self-Defense

Washington does not have a specific castle law, but the State Supreme Court has ruled that there is no duty to retreat if a person is in a place they have the lawful right to occupy and is being assaulted.

### Use of Force

The use of force is justified in the following cases:

*   To prevent or attempt to prevent an offense against oneself or malicious interference with property lawfully possessed, provided the force is not more than necessary.
*   To detain someone unlawfully on real property or in a building, as long as the detention is reasonable in duration and manner for investigating the person's presence and the premises were not reasonably open to the public.

### Justifiable Homicide

Homicide is considered justifiable when committed:

*   In reasonable defense against a felony or imminent danger of great personal injury to any person.
*   In resisting a felony in or upon a dwelling or other place of abode where the person is located.

### Defending Against Violent Crime

A person will not face legal jeopardy for protecting themselves, their family, or their property using any reasonable means necessary, or for assisting another in imminent danger of assault, robbery, kidnapping, arson, burglary, rape, murder, or any other violent crime.
