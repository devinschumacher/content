# Alabama Concealed Carry Laws

Alabama is generally a shall-issue state with concealed weapons permits issued at the county level by the local sheriffâ€™s office. However, a Sheriff may deny a permit application if it is determined that the person is prohibited from possessing a pistol or firearm pursuant to state or federal law, or if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person may use a weapon unlawfully or in a manner that would endanger themselves or others.

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

Alabama allows open carry without a permit. Any person who is at least 19 years old and legally entitled to possess a firearm can open carry. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and courthouses.

On March 10, 2022, Gov. Kay Ivey signed HB 272, the constitutional carry bill, into law. Beginning on January 1, 2023, any law-abiding Alabama resident or other law-abiding citizen (regardless of the state in which they reside) who is at least 19 years old and legally permitted to carry a firearm will no longer be required to obtain a permit to carry a concealed pistol. The bill does not address the age for carry. However, Alabama Rep. Shane Stringerâ€™s office indicated that Alabama Code Section 13A-11-72 prohibits a minor from possessing a firearm unless engaged in a competition, at the range, hunting, etc. under the supervision of an adult. See (f) 1 to 7.

Concealed carry is legal for residents with an Alabama Pistol Permit and for non-residents with a permit from a state that Alabama honors. Alabama does not require the applicant to complete a firearms safety course or otherwise demonstrate knowledge of firearms safety prior to issuing a pistol permit. Only residents who are at least 19 years old may obtain Alabama pistol permits. However, the county sheriff may issue a permit to active-duty military stationed in Alabama (18 years old and older) and their spouses. Active duty military veterans that meet the qualifications can obtain or renew their pistol permits free of charge. In terms of reciprocity, Alabama honors all out-of-state concealed carry permits.

# Self-Defense

Alabama is a Castle Doctrine state. Per Alabama gun laws, you do not have a duty to retreat and are allowed to stand your ground, provided you are in a place where you have a right to be and you are not engaged in unlawful activity.

### Civil and Criminal Immunity

A person who uses force, including deadly physical force, as justified and permitted in this section is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action for the use of such force, unless the force was determined to be unlawful.

### Use of Force in Defense of Self or Another

A person is justified in using physical force to defend themselves or a third person from what they reasonably believe to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by another person. They may use a degree of force they reasonably believe to be necessary for this purpose.

There are several circumstances in which the law allows a person to use deadly force for self-defense purposes, including:

*   When a person reasonably believes that another is about to use unlawful deadly force.
    
*   When an occupant of a dwelling reasonably believes that a burglar is about to use physical force.
    
*   When another attempts to forcibly or unlawfully enter a personâ€™s dwelling, residence, business property, or occupied vehicle, or attempts to remove a person who has a legal right to be there.
    
*   When a person is attempting to thwart another who is engaged in the act of rape, sodomy, kidnapping, assault, or robbery.
    
*   When an owner, employee, or other person authorized to be on business property when the business is closed to the public encounters a person committing or attempting to commit a crime involving death, serious physical injury, robbery, kidnapping, rape, sodomy, or a crime of a sexual nature involving a child under the age of 12.

### Use of Force in Defense of Premises

A person in lawful possession or control of premises, or a person who is licensed or privileged to be there, may use physical force when and to the extent that they reasonably believe it necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass by another person.

A person may use deadly physical force in defense of property only when they reasonably believe it necessary to prevent the commission of arson in the first or second degree by the trespasser.

### Use of Force in Defense of Property Other than Premises

A person is justified in using physical force, other than deadly physical force, upon another person when and to the extent that they reasonably believe it necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission by the other person of theft or criminal mischief with respect to property other than premises.
