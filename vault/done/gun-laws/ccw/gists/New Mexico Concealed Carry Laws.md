## Summary of New Mexico Gun Laws

As of July 1, 2019, per SB-8, background checks are mandatory for private sales of firearms in New Mexico. It is illegal to sell a gun without a background check conducted by a licensed federal firearms dealer, with some exceptions such as sales between law enforcement officers or immediate family members.

### Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

Residents of New Mexico must obtain a Concealed Handgun License (CHL) to carry a concealed loaded firearm. Non-residents may carry with a permit from a state that New Mexico honors. CHL holders are restricted to carrying one concealed firearm at a time, as specified by the license regarding category and caliber. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and complete a 15-hour handgun safety course, including live-fire instruction. Exceptions include military members permanently stationed in New Mexico and their dependents.

### Self-Defense Laws

While New Mexico does not have a specific Castle Doctrine statute, State v. Couch (1946) established principles allowing individuals threatened with an attack to stand their ground and use necessary force in self-defense. Homicide is justifiable under New Mexico law in cases where it occurs:

*   In defense of one’s life, family, or others against imminent threat of harm.
*   To prevent a felony or great personal injury when there is reasonable belief of danger.
*   During lawful attempts to apprehend a felon, suppress a riot, or maintain peace.

Defendants claiming self-defense must demonstrate reasonable fear of immediate harm, use of proportional force to counter the threat, and non-provocation of the incident.

\[N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-2-7\]
