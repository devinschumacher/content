### Carrying a Weapon

(a) A person commits the offense of carrying a weapon if they possess a handgun, knife, or club on or about their person, in a vehicle they occupy, or readily available for use, with the intent to unlawfully use it as a weapon against another person.

**History:** 2021, №956, § 2.

The Arkansas Appeals Court, in case No. CR-18–353 Jamie Taff v. State of Arkansas on October 17, 2018, stated that merely possessing a handgun does not violate § 5–73–120(a) unless there is unlawful intent to use it as a weapon against a person.

**Note:** Arkansas clarified the debate on permitless carry in 2023 with the statute below.

### Places Off-Limits Even With a Permit/License

### Carrying on Public University/College Campuses

To carry on public university or college campuses in Arkansas, you must have additional training and an endorsement on your Arkansas License to Carry. This option is available only to those with an Arkansas License to Carry with an endorsement, not for licenses from other states that Arkansas honors. It is recommended to read all of § 5–73–305, § 5–73–306, and § 5–73–322 for comprehensive information.

The endorsement allows carrying in certain public buildings, although regular license holders cannot. The Attorney General of Arkansas has stated that publicly owned buildings that serve alcohol can prohibit those with an endorsement from carrying there by posting a sign.

### Prohibited Places (§ 5–73–306)

A license to carry a concealed handgun does not authorize carrying into:

  1. Any police or sheriff’s station.
  2. Arkansas Highway Police facilities.
  3. Detention facilities, prisons, jails, or certain treatment facilities.
  4. Courthouses or buildings used for court proceedings, with specific exceptions.
  5. Courtrooms, unless allowed by a judge.
  6. Governmental meeting places.
  7. Meetings of the General Assembly.
  8. State offices.
  9. Non-firearm-related athletic events.
  10. Establishments licensed to serve alcohol, with certain conditions.
  11. Schools, colleges, or university buildings or events, with specific exceptions.
  12. Airport passenger terminals (unless encased for transport).
  13. Churches or places of worship, with the option for these places to determine who may carry.
  14. Places prohibited by federal law.
  15. Parades or demonstrations requiring a permit.
  16. Locations with signage prohibiting concealed handguns.



Additional restrictions apply to private entities that prohibit carrying concealed handguns, including private universities, churches, and establishments serving alcohol.

### Parking Lots and Private Property

License holders may carry in publicly owned parking lots under specific conditions and on private property as long as the owner does not prohibit it with proper signage.

For further information on specific restrictions and allowances, it is advisable to consult the Arkansas Code or contact the appropriate authorities.
