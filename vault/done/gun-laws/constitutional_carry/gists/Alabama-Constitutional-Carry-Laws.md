### Permitless Carry

(a) A person licensed to carry a handgun in any state is authorized to carry a handgun in this state. This applies to a license holder from another state only while they are not a resident of this state. They must carry the handgun in compliance with the laws of this state. The issuance of a permit to carry a pistol or the recognition of a nonresident license does not impose a general prohibition on carrying a pistol without a permit.

(b) The Attorney General may enter into reciprocal agreements with other states for mutual recognition of licenses to carry handguns and shall periodically publish a list of states that recognize licenses issued under this section.

### State of Emergency Provisions

(a) These provisions apply only during a state of emergency as defined in Section 31‚Äì9‚Äì3. A state of emergency can be declared by the Governor or through a joint resolution of the Legislature if an attack on the United States is occurring or anticipated, or if a major natural disaster or public health emergency is imminent or has occurred in the state, necessitating the invocation of these provisions for the safety and welfare of the inhabitants. The state of emergency will end 60 days after being proclaimed unless extended by the Governor or Legislature. The Governor may also call the Legislature into special session during this period. Additionally, the Lieutenant Governor or Speaker of the House can request a special session. During the emergency, the Governor may exercise additional powers:

  * Establish agencies and offices and appoint temporary personnel as needed without regard to the Merit System Act.



(d)

  1. This section does not authorize the seizure or confiscation of any firearm or ammunition from an individual lawfully carrying or possessing it, except as noted in subdivision (2).
  2. A law enforcement officer, in the lawful discharge of duties, may disarm an individual if deemed immediately necessary for protection. The officer must return the firearm unless the individual is arrested for criminal activity, the firearm is seized as evidence, or the individual poses a threat to themselves or others.



### Local Emergency Management Organizations

(a) Each political subdivision is directed to establish a local emergency management organization according to the state plan, potentially granting auxiliary police powers similar to peace officers with specific restrictions. The governing body can appoint a director responsible for the organization‚Äôs administration and operations, under its direction. These organizations handle emergency management within their jurisdiction and as required beyond it.

(e)

  1. This section does not authorize the seizure or confiscation of any firearm or ammunition from an individual lawfully carrying or possessing it, except as noted in subdivision (2).



**Note:** Federal law may apply if the state receives assistance from the Federal Government. See US Code 42‚Äì5207 for applicable federal laws during emergencies. Review the entire state code on Emergency Powers for comprehensive details.
