Gun violence in American cities and mass shootings nationwide continue to fuel debates on gun control laws. In 2023, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham declared a public health emergency due to rising gun violence, prompted by several child-related gun fatalities within weeks.

Her administration initially suspended open and concealed carry in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County via public health orders, later amended after legal challenges from gun rights advocates. Balancing the rights of gun owners and public safety remains challenging amid polarized political climates.

Federal law, rooted in the Second Amendment, protects citizensâ€™ rights to own guns for lawful purposes like self-defense. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions affirm gun ownership as an individual right, scrutinizing laws that burden this right through historical context and alignment with firearm regulation traditions.

Federal firearm laws regulate interstate commerce, overseeing licenses, taxation, and lawful manufacture, sale, and possession of specific firearms. Licensed dealers must conduct criminal background checks via the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), barring access to felons, drug users, and others prohibited by law.

New Mexico Gun Control Laws: Residents must comply with both federal and state laws. While the Second Amendment guarantees gun ownership rights, states can enact additional regulations, including restrictions on purchase, possession, and carrying of firearms, and bans on certain weapons and accessories.

New Mexicoâ€™s gun laws are moderate, requiring private gun sales to undergo background checks. Residents must obtain a concealed carry permit to carry a concealed handgun.

Key Statutes:

  * **Concealed Carry:** Requires a state-issued license for carrying concealed loaded handguns.
  * **Open Carry:** Permitted, subject to location restrictions.
  * **Red Flag Law:** Allows court orders against persons posing danger with access to firearms.
  * **License Requirements:** No license needed for gun ownership; concealed carry requires eligibility proof and training.
  * **Penalties:** Include felonies for unlawful possession and misdemeanors for other offenses like negligent weapon use and firearm sale without background checks.

New Mexico law does not ban specific firearm types but regulates possession, especially in sensitive locations like schools and liquor establishments. It does not impose a waiting period for gun purchases, though eligibility criteria and background checks apply to firearm transactions.
