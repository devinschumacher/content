# Maryland Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Maryland Gun Laws

Maryland has transitioned to a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court’s ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen case on June 23rd, 2022. The issuance of concealed weapons permits is overseen by the Secretary of the Maryland State Police.

### Handgun Purchases and Registration

*   A permit, background check, and firearm registration are mandatory for purchasing handguns from private individuals.
*   Private firearms transactions involving handguns and assault weapons must go through a licensed dealer or designated law enforcement agency, which conducts a background check.
*   Maryland maintains a handgun roster that limits the sale of handguns by dealers and private sellers, with few exceptions.

### Concealed Carry Regulations

*   Concealed carry is restricted to holders of Maryland Wear/Carry Handgun Permits (WCHP). Open carry was prohibited as of October 1, 2023.
*   Applicants for a WCHP must be at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for employment purposes only) and complete a state-approved 16-hour firearms training course that includes live-fire training. Renewals require an additional eight hours of training.
*   Permits are available to both residents and non-residents. Certain areas, such as rest areas and state parks, are off-limits.
*   Maryland does not recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states.

### Self-Defense Laws

*   Maryland follows common law principles akin to Castle Doctrine, without specific statutory provisions.
*   There is a duty to retreat, obliging individuals outside their homes to retreat or avoid danger if feasible before resorting to deadly force.
*   Deadly force is justified when defending against immediate threat of serious injury or death, under the conditions that:
*   There are reasonable grounds to believe in imminent danger.
*   The defender did not provoke the conflict.
*   The force used was not excessive given the circumstances.
*   According to Maryland Code, individuals are shielded from liability for personal injury or death of an intruder in their dwelling or place of business if force or deadly force is deemed necessary to repel an attack, and such force is reasonable under the circumstances.
