Holders of a permanently expired license will have to submit a new application.

**Step 2:**

Complete the application form and have it notarized.

**Step 3:**

*   A passport-style color photograph taken within the preceding 30 days; and
*   A check, for $25 (payable to Kansas Attorney General).

**Step 4:**

When approved, licensees receive a notice of approval to renew their license. The notice of approval must be taken to a Kansas Driver‚Äôs License Station for issuance. Licenses will be renewed for 4 years from the date of expiration.
