# New Jersey Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of New Jersey Gun Laws

New Jersey operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons permits, with permits issued locally by municipal police departments or the NJ State Police. Applicants must secure approval from their local police chief and subsequently present their application to a superior court judge.

To purchase a handgun from a private individual, New Jersey residents must possess a Firearms Purchaser Identification (FPID) card and undergo a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) through a licensed firearms dealer. All purchases, whether from a dealer or a private seller, require a copy of the purchase permit sent to the NJ State Police Firearms Investigations Unit. An FPID is also mandatory for buying handgun ammunition from dealers within the state.

Open carry is prohibited throughout New Jersey. Concealed carry is only legal with a New Jersey Permit to Carry a Handgun (PCH), which is available to both residents and non-residents. Applicants must complete a firearms training course and be at least 21 years old. New Jersey does not recognize permits from other states.

**Use of Force in Defense of Dwelling**: Force or deadly force against an intruder unlawfully in a dwelling is justifiable when the actor reasonably believes it necessary to protect against imminent unlawful force.

Do handguns need to be registered in New Jersey?

Firearms registration is voluntary, but since handgun purchase permit records are maintained by the New Jersey State Police Firearms Investigation Unit, there is de facto mandatory handgun registration for handguns purchased in state. Firearms which have been legally acquired in another state and are legal to possess in New Jersey may be brought to New Jersey by the owner when residency is established. According to the NJSP Firearms Investigation Unit's website, "the owner may voluntarily register the firearm(s) by completing a Voluntary Form of Firearms Registration \[Form S.P. 650\], found on this website, however the owner is not obligated to do so."

**Background Checks for Private Gun Sales? Exceptions?**

A permit to purchase or a firearms purchaser identification card shall not be required for the passing of a firearm upon the death of an owner thereof to his or her heir or legatee. If the heir or legatee of the firearm does not qualify to possess or carry it, he or she may retain ownership of the firearm for the purpose of sale for no more 180 days, or for a further limited period as may be approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the heir or legatee resides. \[N.J. Stat. Ann. ¬ß 2C:58-3\]

## Handgun Purchase Process

To purchase a firearm in New Jersey, you must have a Firearms Purchaser Identification Card. This can be obtained by filing an Application For Firearms Purchaser Identification Card / Application To Purchase A Handgun with the New Jersey State Police. The form can be completed and then submitted in person at your local municipal police department or a New Jersey State Police Department that covers your jurisdiction. You may also apply online through the Firearms Applicant Registration System. If you do choose to apply online, you must contact the police department that covers your jurisdiction first and obtain the proper Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) number before starting the application.

To complete your application, you will also need to provide a New Jersey driver's license or state-issued ID card and list 2 references who can attest to your good character and sound mental health. In addition to this, you will need to consent to fingerprinting and a criminal and mental health background check. A Consent for Mental Health Records Search Form (SP 66) is required.

After your application and consent forms are submitted, the State of New Jersey has 30 days to notify you if you are approved or denied for your Firearms Purchaser Identification Card. If approved, you have 90 days to purchase a handgun before the permit expires.
