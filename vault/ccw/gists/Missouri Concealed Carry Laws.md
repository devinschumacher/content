# Missouri Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Missouri Gun Laws

Missouri is a permitless carry state and a shall-issue state. Permits are issued for reciprocity purposes by county sheriffs.

No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal in Missouri without a Concealed Carry Permit (CCP) for anyone 19 years or older who can legally possess a firearm (18 for members of the military or honorably discharged). Local authorities can restrict concealed carry in any building owned, leased, or controlled by the county or municipality and may require a CCP for open carry. Missouri law defines ‚Äúunlawful use of a weapon‚Äù to apply when a person carries a weapon into a place that is off-limits per Missouri law.

To obtain a Missouri CCP, you must be at least 19 years old (18 for members of the military or honorably discharged) and have passed a firearms training course. The application must be made in your county of residence. Non-resident permits are available only to active military duty personnel or veterans who are at least 18 years old and stationed in Missouri. Restricted locations include courthouses and public passenger buses and trains. Since permitless carry is legal in Missouri, anyone 19 years or older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

## Self-Defense

Missouri is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. This law allows individuals to defend themselves outside their homes or properties without the requirement to retreat, assuming the person was not the initial aggressor and is not attempting to commit a crime.

**Physical Force is Justifiable:**

  

*   When an individual believes that the physical force used is necessary for the defense of themselves or others from unlawful force.
*   When an individual believes that the force is reasonably necessary to prevent another person from stealing, damaging, or tampering with property.

**Deadly Force is Justifiable:**

  

*   When an individual reasonably believes that the force is necessary for self-defense or defense of others (including unborn children) to prevent death, serious physical injury, or a forcible felony.
*   When an individual uses such force against a person who unlawfully enters a dwelling, residence, or vehicle.
*   When an individual uses such force against a person who unlawfully enters, attempts to enter, or remains after unlawfully entering private property where the owner or authorized individual claims justification for using protective force under this law.

In 2016, the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Eastern District held in State v. Whipple that deadly force under the castle doctrine can only be used when you reasonably believe such force is necessary to protect yourself or someone else from ‚Äúthe use or imminent use of unlawful force‚Äù and not solely to protect property.

Missouri law also prohibits political subdivisions from precluding the use of firearms to defend people or property.
