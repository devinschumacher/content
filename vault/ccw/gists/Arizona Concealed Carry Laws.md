**Carry in Bars/Restaurants that Serve Alcohol?**Can you carry a concealed firearm in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol in Arizona?

*   Arizona's statutes are contradictory as ARS ¬ß 4-229(A) indicates no permit is required to concealed carry in a bar/restaurant that serves alcohol while 4-244(29) and (30) indicate concealed carry is legal with or without a permit, unless posted and provided you don‚Äôt consume any alcohol. \[Ariz.

# Key State Laws

**Driver's License Linked to Permit?**Is my Arizona driver‚Äôs license linked to my Arizona concealed weapons permit?

*   No. Your Arizona driver‚Äôs license is not linked to your Arizona concealed weapons permit. Therefore, a law enforcement officer (LEO) will not be notified that you are a concealed carry permit holder immediately when they run your driver‚Äôs license. However, LEOs may have access to other databases where they can obtain this information.
    

**Preemption?**Does Arizona have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?

*   Yes. There is full state preemption of all gun laws. In addition, Section 13-3108 provides that if a court determines a political subdivision has knowingly violated the preemption law, the court may assess a civil penalty of up to $50,000, and if a court determines that a state official enacting a law or rule knowingly violated the preemption law, that person's term may be subject to termination. \[Ariz. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 13-3108\]
    

**Red Flag Law?**Does Arizona have a red flag law?

*   No. Arizona does not have a red flag law.

**Carry While Consuming Alcohol?**Does Arizona have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while consuming alcohol?

*   No consumption allowed. \[Ariz. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 4-244(31)\]
    
*   As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities.
    

**"No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced?**Are "No Weapons Allowed" signs enforced in Arizona?

*   Yes. A person commits misconduct involving weapons by knowingly entering any public establishment or attending any public event carrying a deadly weapon after a reasonable request by the operator, sponsor, or the sponsor's agent to remove his or her weapon and place it in the custody of the operator or sponsor for temporary and secure storage of the weapon. Misconduct involving weapons is a class 1 misdemeanor. \[Ariz. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 13-3102 & 13-3102.01\]
    
*   Additionally, Arizona law permits private business owners (or their designates) to prohibit weapons from being brought onto their property, whether signs are posted or not. Failure to obey the request can result in your arrest for trespassing (ARS 13-1502/ARS 13-1503).
    

**Duty to Inform Officer You're Carrying?**Do you have a duty to notify a police officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Arizona?

**Brandishing?**Does Arizona state law define brandishing?

*   No definition of brandishing was found in Arizona law. However, a person commits the crime of disorderly conduct if they recklessly handle, display, or discharge a deadly weapon. Defensive displays of a firearm without justification could also be charged as aggravated assault. Defensive displays include actions such as putting your hand on a firearm while it is concealed in a pocket, sweeping the jacket to expose the firearm, or saying you have a firearm without drawing or waving it.
    
*   However, Arizona statutes specifically allow defensive displays and protect a citizen against being prosecuted for it when it is justified. \[Ariz Rev. Stat ¬ß¬ß13-2904 and 13-421\]
