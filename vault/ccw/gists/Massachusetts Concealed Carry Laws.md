# Massachusetts Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Massachusetts Gun Laws

Massachusetts is now a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen case on June 23rd, 2022. Licenses to Carry (LTC) are issued at local police stations or through the State Police Firearms Records Bureau for non-residents.

### Firearm Purchase and Licensing

A Firearm Identification (FID) card or LTC is required to purchase a firearm. Background checks are mandatory for buying handguns from private individuals, who must verify the buyer‚Äôs Firearm Identification Card with the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services. An LTC is also necessary to purchase ammunition. While handgun registration isn‚Äôt mandated, all firearm sales and transfers must be reported to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, which maintains comprehensive records.

### Open and Concealed Carry

Formerly, Class B licenses allowed only open carry of non-large capacity firearms. No new Class B licenses are issued due to licensure revisions. Concealed carry is permitted with a Massachusetts LTC or a previously issued, valid Class A LTC. The minimum age for an LTC is 21, available to both residents and non-residents, contingent upon completing a state-approved firearms training course. Certain locations are restricted, such as schools and airports. Massachusetts does not recognize permits from other states.

### Self-Defense Laws

Massachusetts operates under Castle Doctrine principles. It allows for defense in a dwelling against an unlawful intruder if the occupant reasonably believes the intruder poses a threat of serious injury or death. There‚Äôs no obligation to retreat within one‚Äôs dwelling but outside the home, retreat is required when feasible.

‚ÄúDwelling‚Äù includes permanent or temporary residences but excludes common areas of buildings like hallways. Tents, motor homes, and boats may not qualify as dwellings under this doctrine.

## Massachusetts Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

  

## License Renewal FAQ:

### Step 1:

Renewals are the responsibility of the licensee. You must renew your resident firearms license to carry or firearms identification card through your local police department in the town where you reside. You must submit your renewal application prior to the expiration date of your current license. If submitted prior to expiration, you will have an indefinite grace period in which your current license will remain valid after expiration. This grace period will stay in effect until the submitted application for renewal is either approved or denied by the licensing authority. If you do not submit your application for renewal prior to expiration of your current license, that license will expire and no longer be valid and you will need to apply for a new FID or LTC.

Non-resident and resident alien firearms licenses expire annually and must be renewed through the Firearms Records Bureau. There is no grace period for non-resident firearms licenses or resident alien permits.

### Step 2:

You will need to submit:

  

*   A complete resident firearms license application, non-resident firearms license application, or resident alien permit application;
*   The required application fee.

You may need to submit:

  

*   A Massachusetts Basic Firearms Safety Course certificate.
*   A form of identification.
*   Proof of residence.

Residents must mail the complete renewal package to your local licensing authority.

Non-Residents and Resident Aliens must mail the complete renewal package to the Firearms Records Bureau at: **Department of Criminal Justice Information Services** **Firearms Records Bureau** **200 Arlington Street, Suite 2200** **Chelsea, MA 02150**

### Step 3:

You will be notified within 60 days (90 days for Non-Residents and Resident Aliens) when your firearms license application has been processed, either by telephone or by mail. You may need to pick up your firearms license in person.
