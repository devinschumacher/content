# Arkansas Concealed Carry Laws

# Summary of Arkansas Gun Laws

Arkansas operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state where concealed weapons licenses are issued by the Department of Public Safety.

### Handgun Purchases

No license, background check, or firearms registration is required for purchasing handguns from private individuals in Arkansas.

### Open Carry Laws

Permitless open carry is legal in Arkansas for individuals aged 18 and older who can legally possess firearms. However, certain places such as schools and bars are off-limits.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry without a license is allowed in Arkansas for individuals over 18 who can legally possess firearms, particularly when on a journey outside of their home or property. Residents aged 21 or older (or 18 and in the U.S. Armed Forces or National Guard) can obtain a Concealed Handgun Carry License (CHCL), which requires state-approved firearms training. Arkansas also offers an Enhanced Concealed Carry License (E-CHCL) that permits carrying in additional locations such as public colleges, most public buildings, non-secure airport areas, and churches, requiring approximately 8 hours of extra training.

### Non-Resident Licenses and Reciprocity

Arkansas does not issue non-resident licenses, but active-duty military and their spouses may apply for an Arkansas CHCL. Due to permitless carry, individuals who can legally possess firearms may carry concealed without a license or permit in Arkansas, impacting reciprocity considerations.

### Use of Physical Force

#### Justification for Physical Force

Arkansas law justifies using physical force that a person reasonably believes is necessary to defend themselves or another from unlawful physical force.

#### Use of Deadly Physical Force

Deadly physical force is justified in Arkansas if a person reasonably believes another is committing a felony involving physical force or violence, using unlawful deadly physical force, or engaged in a pattern of domestic abuse. There is no duty to retreat if lawfully present and not the aggressor.

#### Defense of Premises and Property

In Arkansas, individuals may use non-deadly physical force to prevent or stop criminal trespass or theft. Deadly physical force is justified to prevent arson or burglary by a trespasser.

### Self-Defense

Arkansas upholds the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to defend themselves and their property from unlawful intrusion into their home. The state also implements a "stand your ground" law, permitting self-defense without a duty to retreat wherever a person is lawfully present.
