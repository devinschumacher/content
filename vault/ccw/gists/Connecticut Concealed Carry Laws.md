# Connecticut Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Connecticut Gun Laws

Connecticut is a may-issue state, meaning that local law enforcement has discretion in determining whether to issue a permit to carry a handgun to an applicant based on a ‚Äúsuitability clause.‚Äù This clause applies to both the issuance of new permits and the revocation of existing permits. There is a two-step process to obtain a permit. First, an applicant must apply for a temporary permit from the local authorities, and then they must submit another application at the state level through the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP).

To purchase a handgun, a buyer must have a Connecticut Pistol Permit (CTPP) or obtain a Certificate of Eligibility for Pistols and Revolvers, Long Guns, or Ammunition. A background check is required to buy a handgun from a private individual, as private party firearms transfers must be performed by a federally licensed dealer.

Concealed carry is legal in Connecticut with a CTPP. The minimum age is 21. Open carry is illegal as of October 1, 2023. Connecticut residents, as well as non-residents with a valid CCW license from their home state, can apply for a CTPP. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and state parks. CTPPs require a state-approved firearms training course that includes live-fire exercises. Connecticut does not honor permits from any other states.

## Use of Physical Force in Defense of Person

A person is justified in using reasonable physical force to defend themselves or a third person from what they reasonably believe to be the use or imminent use of physical force. The person may use such a degree of force which is reasonably believed to be necessary for this purpose. Deadly physical force may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that the other person is using or about to use deadly physical force, or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.

## Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property

A person is justified in using reasonable physical force when they reasonably believe it to be necessary to prevent an attempt to commit larceny or criminal mischief involving property. However, deadly physical force can only be used in defense of a person.

## Use of Physical Force in Defense of Premises

A person in possession or control of premises, or someone licensed or privileged to be on such premises, is justified in using reasonable physical force when they reasonably believe it to be necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass. Deadly physical force may be used under such circumstances only:

*   In defense of a person;
*   When it is reasonably believed to be necessary to prevent an attempt by the trespasser to commit arson or any crime of violence; or
*   To prevent or terminate an unlawful entry by force into a dwelling or place of work, solely for the purpose of such prevention or termination.
