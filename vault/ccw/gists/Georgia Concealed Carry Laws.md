# Georgia Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Georgia Gun Laws

Georgia operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons licenses, which are issued at the county level and processed through the probate court in the resident's county.

### Handgun Purchase and Ownership

No license, background check, or firearms registration is required for purchasing a handgun from a private individual in Georgia.

  

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Georgia with a Georgia Weapons Carry License (WCL) or a valid concealed carry permit from a state recognized by Georgia. Certain locations, such as schools and courthouses, remain off-limits. Constitutional carry legislation was signed into law on April 12, 2022, but it does not address open carry.

### Concealed Carry Permits

Residents of Georgia can legally carry concealed firearms with a WCL or any lawful weapons carrier status. Non-residents with a valid license/permit from another state are also permitted. There is no mandatory firearms training requirement for obtaining a Georgia WCL. Applicants must be at least 21 years old (18 for military personnel).

### Specific Carrying Privileges

No license is necessary to carry a handgun within one's home, vehicle, place of business, while engaged in fishing or hunting, or when unloaded and in a case. Kennesaw city law requires heads of households to maintain a firearm, a mandate enacted in 1982.

### Reciprocity

Governor Kemp signed HB 218 on April 12, 2022, recognizing firearms licenses from all states. License holders whose permits expired during the COVID state of emergency must apply for renewal within 120 days of the expiration date.

### Constitutional Carry

SB 319, effective immediately upon signing on April 12, 2022, allows for constitutional carry in Georgia.

## Self-Defense Laws

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Georgia is a Castle Doctrine state with a "stand your ground" statute, meaning there is no obligation to retreat in defense against forcible felonies like rape, armed robbery, or kidnapping.

### Defense of Habitation

A person can use force to prevent unlawful entry or attack on their habitation, including deadly force if the intruder forcefully enters with intent to commit violence or a felony.

### Defense of Property

Force can be used to prevent trespass or criminal interference with real or personal property, including deadly force in cases involving forcible felonies.

Definitions:

  

*   **Habitation:** Includes dwellings, motor vehicles, and places of business.
*   **Personal Property:** Excludes motor vehicles.

**Store in a Vehicle in an Employee Parking Lot?**

Does Georgia have laws relating to storing firearms in private vehicles in an employee parking lot?

No private or public employer, including the state and its political subdivisions, can condition employment upon any agreement by a prospective employee on prohibiting firearms or ammunition in the employees privately owned motor vehicle, provided any firearm or ammunition is locked and out of sight and the employee has a Georgia weapons carry license.

This provision does not apply to an employer providing a secure parking area not accessible to the general public or to an area used for parking on a temporary basis, among other exceptions. In addition, this provision does not restrict the rights of private property owners or persons in legal control of property, and when a private property owner or person in legal control of property is also an employer, his or her rights as a private property owner or person in legal control of property govern.

State law allows a license holder to possess a firearm in a motor vehicle parked in a parking facility of a government entity, courthouse, jail, prison, place of worship, bar or school safety zone, so long as the firearm is in the locked compartment of the vehicle, or in a locked container in or a locked firearms rack on the vehicle.

Moving from Georgia and have a Georgia resident license? Does that license transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your Georgia license remains valid?

If a person with a Georgia weapons carry license establishes residency in another state, the license expires upon the establishment of residence in the other state.
