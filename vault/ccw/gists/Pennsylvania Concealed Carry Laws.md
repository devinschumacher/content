# Pennsylvania Concealed Carry Laws

## Pennsylvania Gun Laws

Pennsylvania operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons licenses, issued at the county level by the sheriff’s office or, for residents of first-class cities, by the city's chief of police.

### Purchase and Transfer

No permit is required to purchase firearms in Pennsylvania, and while there is no comprehensive firearms registration, the state police maintain a database of handgun buyers. Private-party transfers of handguns must be conducted through a licensed dealer or at a county sheriff’s office, with exemptions for transfers between close family members.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal for individuals aged 18 or older who are legally eligible to possess a firearm. However, a Pennsylvania License to Carry Firearms (LCF) or a permit from a reciprocal state is required to open or conceal carry in a vehicle and to open carry in Philadelphia. Recent legal decisions have brought some uncertainty regarding the definition of open carry in the state.

### Concealed Carry

Residents aged 21 and older, and non-residents with permits recognized by Pennsylvania, can legally carry concealed firearms. Following a recent court ruling, individuals aged 18-20 are also eligible for permits. Pennsylvania does not impose a training requirement for license issuance, and reciprocity for out-of-state licenses is limited to states with formal agreements.

### Self-Defense Laws

Pennsylvania upholds Castle Doctrine principles and a "stand your ground" law, allowing individuals to use force, including deadly force, in defense against unlawful threats in their home or any place they legally occupy. There is generally no duty to retreat, except in specific circumstances. Deadly force is justified if believed necessary to prevent death, serious injury, kidnapping, or sexual assault, under prescribed conditions detailed in state statutes.

For more detailed and current information, consulting official state resources is advisable.

### Magazine Limits for Handguns?

Does Pennsylvania have magazine capacity restrictions for handguns?

### Ammunition Restrictions?

Does Pennsylvania have ammunition restrictions?

Yes. It is illegal for any person to possess KTW teflon-coated bullets or other armor-piercing ammunition with the intent to use the ammunition in a crime. \[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 6121\]

### Minimum Age for Concealed Carry?

What is the minimum age in Pennsylvania to get a concealed carry license?

The minimum age to concealed carry in Pennsylvania is 21 years old.

### Weapons Other Than Handguns Allowed?

Can you concealed carry weapons other than handguns in Pennsylvania with a concealed carry license (or under permitless carry if applicable)?

Yes. Pennsylvania concealed carry includes any pistol or revolver with a barrel length less than 15 inches, any shotgun with a barrel length less than 18 inches or any rifle with a barrel length less than 16 inches, or any pistol, revolver, rifle or shotgun with an overall length of less than 26 inches. The barrel length of a firearm shall be determined by measuring from the muzzle of the barrel to the face of the closed action, bolt or cylinder, whichever is applicable.

### Tasers or Stun Guns?

Is it legal to own a taser or stun gun in Pennsylvania?

Yes. Stun guns and Tasers are legal to purchase and possess without a permit for anyone legally entitled to carry a firearm. A person may possess and use an electric or electronic incapacitation device in the exercise of reasonable force in defense of the person or the person's property if the electric or electronic incapacitation device is labeled with or accompanied by clearly written instructions as to its use and the damages involved in its use. \[18 Pa. Cons. Stat, § 908.1\]

### Open Carry Permitted?

Is open carry permitted in Pennsylvania?

Yes, without a license. Any person who is at least 18 years old and legally entitled to possess a firearm can open carry. A license is required in a vehicle and in the city of Philadelphia.

Be aware that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Darren Montgomery, 234 A.3d 523 (PA 2020), holding that sometimes a visible firearm is a concealed firearm, has created uncertainty about the definition of open carry.

## Key State Laws

**Brandishing?**

Does Pennsylvania state law define brandishing?

No definition of brandishing was found in Pennsylvania law. However, a person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.

\[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5503\]

**Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?**

Does Pennsylvania have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?

Not addressed in state statutes.

As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

**Non-Resident Permitting?**

Does Pennsylvania issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?

Yes. Non-residents who possess a current license or permit or similar document to carry a firearm issued by their home state (if a license is provided for by the laws of that state) may apply for a non-resident permit.

**Public Access to Concealed Carry Registry?**

Does Pennsylvania allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?

No. The Pennsylvania concealed carry registry is not accessible to the public.

**Driver's License Linked to Carry License?**

Is my Pennsylvania driver’s license linked to my Pennsylvania carry license?

Yes. Your Pennsylvania driver’s license is linked to your Pennsylvania license to carry firearms. Therefore, a law enforcement officer will be notified immediately that you are a concealed carry license holder if they run your driver’s license.

**Duty to Inform Officer You're Carrying?**

Do you have a duty to inform a police officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Pennsylvania?

There is no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Pennsylvania unless the officer asks.

\[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6122\]

**"No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced?**

Are "No Weapons Allowed" signs enforced in Pennsylvania?

No. Pennsylvania does not recognize "No Weapons" signs.

**Preemption?**

Does Pennsylvania have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?

Yes. The authority to regulate firearms is reserved to the state, except local municipalities may regulate the discharge of firearms within the cities boundaries. This has been reinforced by the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas decision against the City of Pittsburgh in Anderson v. City of Pittsburgh. The court found that Pittsburgh's attempt to impose local gun control measures was a clear violation of state preemption law.

\[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6120\]

**Red Flag Law?**

Does Pennsylvania have a red flag law?

Pennsylvania does not have a red flag law.

## Handgun Purchase & Possession

No. Pennsylvania does not require a special permit at the time of handgun purchase.

**Pennsylvania License Exempts from Background Check?**

Does my current Pennsylvania concealed carry license exempt me from needing a background check when I purchase a firearm?

No.

**Background Checks for Private Gun Sales? Exceptions?**

Are background checks required for private gun sales in Pennsylvania? Are there exceptions?

Yes. Private party transfers of handguns must be conducted through a licensed dealer or at a county sheriff’s office. A background check is required. These requirements do not apply to transfers between spouses, parents and children or grandparents and grandchildren.

**Waiting Period?**

Is there a waiting period after purchasing a handgun in Pennsylvania?

No. The state of Pennsylvania does not require a waiting time for handgun purchases.

**Handgun Registration?**

Do handguns need to be registered in Pennsylvania?

No. Handgun registration is not required in Pennsylvania.
