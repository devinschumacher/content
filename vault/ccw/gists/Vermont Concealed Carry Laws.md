Both open carry and concealed carry are legal without a permit in Vermont. Any person 16 or older who can legally possess a firearm is allowed to carry openly or concealed. There is no distinction between residents and non-residents; both are allowed to carry without a permit in Vermont. The state does not issue permits.

## Self-Defense

Vermont does not have a Castle Doctrine or a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law, but courts have consistently ruled that there is no duty to retreat when attacked in one‚Äôs dwelling.

A person is guiltless if they kill or wound another in the following circumstances:

*   In the just and necessary defense of their own life or the life of a family member or guardian.
*   In the suppression of a person attempting to commit murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, burglary, or robbery with force or violence.
