# Maine Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Maine Gun Laws

Maine operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state, where concealed weapons permits are issued by the Department of Public Safety through the Maine State Police.

There is no requirement for a permit, background check, or firearms registration when purchasing a handgun from a private individual in Maine.

Open and concealed carry are legal in Maine without a permit. Individuals aged 21 or older, or at least 18 and active duty or honorably discharged military personnel, who can legally possess a firearm, are allowed to carry openly or concealed. Maine also issues permits for reciprocity purposes.

Maine Permits to Carry Concealed Handguns (CCHs) necessitate completion of a state-approved firearms training course. These permits are available to residents and non-residents aged at least 18. Certain areas are off-limits for carrying firearms, including schools and courthouses.

For reciprocity, since Maine allows permitless carry, individuals aged at least 21 who can legally possess a firearm may carry concealed without a license. Maine recognizes resident concealed handgun permits issued by other states that reciprocally recognize Maine‚Äôs resident CCHs. Permit holders from these states may carry in certain areas, such as Acadia National Park, where individuals carrying under permitless carry laws cannot.

## Self-Defense Laws in Maine

Maine follows the Castle Doctrine, which allows individuals to defend their homes. However, there is no stand your ground law, meaning individuals have a duty to retreat outside their dwelling place.

### Physical Force in Defense of a Person

A person may use non-deadly force to defend themselves or others from imminent unlawful force. Deadly force is justified if the person reasonably believes it necessary to prevent death, serious injury, or certain felonies. Deadly force is not justified if the person provoked the encounter or can safely retreat.

\[Title 17-A, Pt. 1, Ch. 5, ¬ß104 and ¬ß108\]

  

### Use of Force in Defense of Premises

A person on their premises or licensed to be there may use non-deadly force to prevent criminal trespass. Deadly force is justified to prevent arson or if someone unlawfully enters a dwelling place and poses a threat. Demand to cease trespass is required unless doing so would be dangerous.

‚ÄúDwelling place‚Äù excludes structures solely for property storage or uninhabitable former dwellings.
