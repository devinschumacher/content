# Texas Concealed Carry Laws

## ¬†Summary of Texas Gun Laws

Texas is a shall-issue state, with concealed weapons licenses issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety. There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

As of September 1, 2021, permitless concealed carry and open carry are legal for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun. The new law applies to both open carry in a holster and concealed carry, where no part of the firearm is visible. Texas law specifies that openly carried handguns must be kept in a holster. Texas LTCs are issued to both residents and non-residents who are at least 21 years of age (18 if a member or veteran of the U.S. military). They require a four- to six-hour training course as well as passing both a written exam and a shooting proficiency demonstration. Some areas are off-limits, including racetracks and secure areas of airports.

In terms of reciprocity, since Texas allows permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm on his or her person without a license or permit.

United States District Judge Mark T. Pittman ruled that 18 to 20-year-olds must be allowed to carry a handgun outside the home in Texas. He allowed this by letting them get a Texas license to carry. The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) will now issue a Texas LTC to anyone that is at least 18 years old. On January 10, 2023, the Office of General Counsel sent a memo to DPS offices directing them to no longer enforce the state law that bars adults under 21 from carrying handguns in public.

## Self-Defense

Texas is a Castle Doctrine and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù state. There is no duty to retreat from any place a person has a right to be if that person is faced with a situation where he or she has to use force or deadly force to protect himself or herself or another.

### Deadly Force in Defense of Person

The actor‚Äôs belief that deadly force was immediately necessary is presumed to be reasonable if the actor:

*   Knew or had reason to believe that the person against whom the deadly force was used:
*   Unlawfully and with force entered or was attempting to enter the actor‚Äôs occupied habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment;
*   Unlawfully and with force removed or was attempting to remove the actor from the actor‚Äôs habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment; or
*   Was committing or attempting to commit aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery.

A person who uses deadly force within a residence, business, dwelling, or vehicle is presumed to have held a reasonable belief of imminent death or serious bodily injury to self, family, a member of the household, or a person visiting as an invited guest when the force is used against someone who unlawfully and forcibly entered the place.

### Defense of Third Person

A person is justified in using force or deadly force against another to protect a third person if:

*   Under the circumstances as the actor reasonably believes them to be, the actor would be justified in using force or deadly force to protect himself or herself against the unlawful force or unlawful deadly force he or she reasonably believes to be threatening the third person one seeks to protect; and
*   The actor reasonably believes that his or her intervention is immediately necessary to protect the third person.

### Protection of One‚Äôs Own Property

A person in lawful possession of land or tangible, movable property is justified in using force against another when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to prevent or terminate the other‚Äôs trespass on the land or unlawful interference with the property.

### Deadly Force to Protect Property

A person is justified in using deadly force against another to protect land or tangible, movable property if:

*   One would be justified in using force against the other; and
*   When and to the degree he or she reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary:
*   To prevent the other‚Äôs imminent commission of arson, burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, theft during the nighttime, or criminal mischief during the nighttime; or
*   To prevent the other who is fleeing immediately after committing burglary, robbery, aggravated robbery, or theft during the nighttime from escaping with the property; and
*   He or she reasonably believes that:
*   The land or property cannot be protected or recovered by any other means; or
*   The use of force other than deadly force to protect or recover the land or property would expose the actor or another to a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.

### Protection of Third Person‚Äôs Property

A person is justified in using force or deadly force against another to protect land or tangible, movable property of a third person if, under the circumstances as he or she reasonably believes them to be, the actor would be justified in using force or deadly force to protect his or her own land or property.

Texas law presumes you acted reasonably and justifiably if you use deadly force to protect yourself against an unlawful, forceful intrusion into your occupied habitation (a structure that is detached from where you sleep at night is not considered to be your habitation), vehicle, or place of business or employment; or to prevent an unlawful, forceful attempt to remove a lawful occupant from the occupied habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment; or to prevent certain serious felonies such as burglary or arson.

### Using Force

A person is justified in using force when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to protect the actor against the attempted use of unlawful force. The actor‚Äôs belief that the force was immediately necessary is presumed to be reasonable if the actor:

*   Knew or had reason to believe that the person against whom the force was used:
*   Unlawfully and with force entered or was attempting to enter the actor‚Äôs occupied habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment;
*   Unlawfully and with force removed or was attempting to remove the actor from the actor‚Äôs habitation, vehicle, or place of business or employment; or
*   Was committing or attempting to commit aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery.

## ¬†Store In A Vehicle In An Employee Parking Lot

Yes. A public or private employer may not prohibit an employee who holds a valid concealed carry license from transporting or storing a firearm or ammunition the employee is authorized by law to possess in a locked, privately owned motor vehicle in a parking area the employer provides for employees, except in locations prohibited by state or federal law. This includes school districts or open-enrollment charter schools per Texas Education Code ‚Äã‚Äã¬ß 37.0815 and institutions of higher education per Gov. Code ¬ß 411.2032, provided that the firearm or ammunition is not in plain view. There are exceptions including oil and gas refineries.

## Carry In Vehicle

**Can You Carry A Concealed Handgun In A Vehicle In Texas?**

Yes, without a license as of September 1, 2021. However, it is an offense if it is in plain view, unless it is in a holster and you are either 21 years old or have a Texas LTC or a permit that Texas honors and provided you are not engaging in a criminal activity (other than a traffic violation). There are exemptions for peace officers, military, and other security and governmental professionals.

## Carry At Roadside Rest Areas

**Can You Carry A Concealed Firearm At Roadside Rest Areas In Texas?**

Yes, without a license for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun.

## Carry In State/National Parks, State/National Forests, and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs)

**Can You Carry A Concealed Firearm In State/National Parks, State/National Forests, and Wildlife Management Areas In Texas?**

Yes, without a license for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun. No firearms are allowed on or across the land of the Lower Colorado River Authority (Tex. Parks & Wild. Code ¬ß 62.081), on or over the water of Murvaul Lake in Panola County (Texas Parks and Wild. Code ¬ß 283.022), or in the following game sanctuaries:

*   The state-owned riverbeds in LaSalle County (Texas Parks and Wild. Code ¬ß 82.712)
*   The state-owned riverbeds in McMullen County (Texas Parks and Wild. Code ¬ß 82.722)

## Carry In Bars/Restaurants That Serve Alcohol

**Can You Carry A Concealed Firearm In Bars And Restaurants That Serve Alcohol In Texas?**

Carry is prohibited in businesses that sell alcoholic beverages for on-premise consumption whose alcohol sales constitute more than 50% of gross receipts and that display a red sign with "51%" in large red letters superimposed over a warning that says possession of a concealed weapon on the premises is a felony. As of September 1, 2021, only permit holders have a legal defense if effective notice is not given by the business.

You can carry concealed in the restaurant area of an eatery that serves alcohol (those that make less than 51% of their profits from alcohol) without a license.

## Carry/Possess At A Hotel

**Can You Carry Or Possess A Firearm On Hotel Property In Texas?**

As of September 1, 2021, unless possession of a handgun or other firearm or ammunition on hotel property is prohibited by state or federal law, a hotel may not adopt a policy prohibiting a hotel guest from:

*   Carrying or storing a firearm or firearm ammunition in the guest's hotel room or in the guest's vehicle located on the hotel property
*   Carrying a firearm or firearm ammunition directly en route to or from the hotel, guest's hotel room, or the guest's vehicle

A hotel may adopt a policy requiring a hotel guest carrying a firearm or firearm ammunition in a common area on the hotel property to carry a handgun in a concealed manner or carry a firearm or ammunition in a case or bag.

## ¬†Key State Laws

### Driver's License Linked to Carry License?

**Is My Texas Driver‚Äôs License Linked to My Texas Carry License?**

Yes. Texas does show if the registered driver of the car has a license to carry (LTC). When pulled over, the license plate trace shows that data. If the driver's license is run independently of a license plate, it will also show that you have an LTC.

### "No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced?

**Are "No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced in Texas?**

Yes. As of September 1, 2021, signage is complicated in Texas, and anyone carrying a firearm will need to understand the differences between the definitions of each sign. The Firearm Carry Act of 2021 creates two additional weapons signs:

*   Texas Penal Code ¬ß 30.05 signs will indicate locations where just permitless carry of firearms is prohibited. It will be up to private individuals and businesses to decide what their policies will be moving forward regarding permitless carriers.
*   Texas Penal Code ¬ß 30.06 signs indicate locations where concealed carry permit holders cannot carry.
*   Texas Penal Code ¬ß 30.07 signs indicate locations where open carry for permit holders is prohibited.
*   51% signs indicate the establishment sells alcohol by the drink and receives more than 51% of its income from alcohol sales. Only concealed carry permit holders have a legal defense if effective notice has not been provided.
*   Texas Penal Code ¬ß 46.03(o) signs will state "Pursuant to Section 46.03, Penal Code (places weapons prohibited), a person may not carry a firearm or other weapon on this property." If this sign is posted in a conspicuous location, no firearms are allowed.

Regardless of which sign is posted, once a person receives effective consent (either verbal or written notice) that entry on the property is prohibited, he or she must promptly leave or risk being charged with a misdemeanor.

### Red Flag Law?

**Does Texas Have a Red Flag Law?**

No. Texas does not have a red flag law.

### Brandishing?

**Does Texas State Law Define Brandishing?**

No definition of brandishing was found in Texas law. However, a person commits disorderly conduct if he or she intentionally or knowingly displays a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm.

### Non-Resident Permitting?

**Does Texas Issue Concealed Carry Licenses to Non-Residents?**

Yes. The process is the same as for residents.

### Public Access to Concealed Carry Registry?

**Does Texas Allow the Public to Access Concealed Carry Registry Information Through Public Records Law?**

No. However, the information is available to any criminal justice agency.

### Preemption?

**Does Texas Have Preemption Laws Related to Concealed Carry?**

Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Texas, except local municipalities may:

*   Regulate the discharge of firearms within their limits, other than at a sport shooting range.
*   Regulate the carrying of a firearm or air gun by a person other than a person licensed to carry a concealed handgun under Texas law at:
*   A public park.
*   A public meeting of a municipality, county, or other governmental body.
*   A political rally, parade, or official political meeting.
*   A non-firearms-related school, college, or professional athletic event.

In any county building that houses a justice court, county court, county court at law, or district court, or in any office used by these courts, any person who possesses a firearm without the court‚Äôs written authorization, or without complying with any written regulation of the court, is subject to criminal liability.

Based on an Attorney General opinion, counties may prohibit concealed handgun license holders from carrying concealed handguns in county parks, and rapid transit authorities may prohibit concealed handgun licensees from carrying handguns while on public transportation.

### Duty to Inform Officer You're Carrying?

**Do You Have a Duty to Inform a Police Officer That You're Carrying a Concealed Firearm in Texas?**

You have a duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you're carrying a concealed firearm in Texas. When an officer demands that you display identification, you must display both your driver‚Äôs license or identification and your handgun license.

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?

**Does Texas Have Laws Regarding Carrying a Concealed Firearm While Using Alcohol or Drugs?**

As of September 1, 2021, carrying is prohibited if you are intoxicated anywhere other than:

*   On your own property or property under your control, or on private property with the consent of the owner.
*   Inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle or watercraft:
*   That is owned by you or under your control.
*   With the consent of the owner or operator of the vehicle or watercraft.

"Intoxicated" is defined as:

*   Not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body.
*   Having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more.

As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

## ¬†Handgun Purchase & Possession FAQs

**Answer:**¬†No. Texas has no mandatory waiting period for handgun purchases.

### Handgun Registration

### Possess a Handgun on My Private Property Without a License

**Question:**¬†Can I possess/carry a handgun in my home without a license?

**Answer:**¬†Yes. A license is not required in a person‚Äôs own premises or premises under the person's control. ‚ÄúPremises‚Äù includes real property and a recreational vehicle that is being used as living quarters, regardless of whether that use is temporary or permanent.

### Purchase Permits

**Question:**¬†Is a permit required to purchase a handgun in Texas?

**Answer:**¬†No. Permits are not required when buying a handgun in Texas. A Texas LTC qualifies as an alternative to background check requirements for up to 5 years from the date of issuance. Therefore, an LTC expedites a firearms purchase by allowing a licensee to not have to submit to and wait on the results of a background check.

### Background Checks for Private Gun Sales

**Question:**¬†Are background checks required for private gun sales in Texas?

**Answer:**¬†No. Private firearms transfers are not subject to a background check requirement, although federal and state purchaser prohibitions, including age restrictions, still apply. It is recommended that you retain any sales receipts to prove ownership of the gun.

### Texas License Exempts from Background Check

**Question:**¬†Does my current Texas concealed carry license exempt me from needing a background check when I purchase a firearm?

**Answer:**¬†Yes.
