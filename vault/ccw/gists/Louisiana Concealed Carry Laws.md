# Louisiana Concealed Carry Laws

## Louisiana Gun Laws

Louisiana has specific regulations concerning the possession and carry of firearms.

  

### Permit and Carry Laws

Louisiana operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state. This means that individuals aged 18 and older, who are not prohibited from possessing firearms, can openly carry firearms in public without a permit. As of July 4th, 2024, Louisiana also allows concealed carry without a permit for individuals who meet the legal requirements.

Residents and military personnel stationed in Louisiana can obtain Concealed Handgun Permits (CHPs), which are required for concealed carry outside of the permitless carry provision. Non-resident permits are not available. Applicants must be at least 21 years old, complete a firearms training course, and meet other residency requirements.

### Purchasing Firearms

Private handgun sales in Louisiana do not require a permit, background check, or firearms registration.

  

### Restrictions and Off-Limits Areas

While Louisiana permits open carry, certain locations such as parades and bars are off-limits for carrying firearms.

  

## Use of Force Laws

Louisiana law allows the use of force under specific circumstances, including self-defense and defense of others.

  

### Self-Defense and Castle Doctrine

Louisiana follows a Castle Doctrine with "stand your ground" principles, meaning there is no obligation to retreat before using force to defend oneself in any place where one has the legal right to be.

### Defense of Others

Deadly force may be justifiable in Louisiana to protect others when it is reasonably believed that such intervention is necessary.

These laws aim to clarify the rights and responsibilities of firearm owners in Louisiana.

## Louisiana Concealed Carry License FAQs

**Residency Changes:**

Moving to Louisiana and interested in applying for a resident permit? How soon can you apply?

Louisiana issues permits to residents and members of the military permanently stationed in Louisiana with a Louisiana driver’s license or Louisiana state ID only. You can apply for your permit with the Department of Public Safety once you have a Louisiana driver’s license or Louisiana state ID.

Moving from Louisiana and have a Louisiana resident permit? Does that permit transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your Louisiana permit remains valid?

According to LAC 55:I:1309.F, when a permittee ceases to reside in Louisiana the permit becomes invalid and must be returned to the Department of Public Safety. If the individual returns to Louisiana, he or she must reapply for a permit. However, LRS 40:1379.3 J (4) states that a person who maintains a dwelling in Louisiana, but is residing elsewhere as a member of the United States military or as a student, is still considered to be a resident of Louisiana.
