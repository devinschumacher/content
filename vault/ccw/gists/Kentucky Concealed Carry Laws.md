# Kentucky Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Kentucky Gun Laws

Kentucky operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state where licenses are processed by the State Police.

  

### Firearm Purchase and Ownership

No license is required to purchase a firearm from a private individual in Kentucky, and there is no waiting period or firearms registration. However, a background check is mandatory when purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Kentucky for individuals aged 18 and above who are not prohibited from possessing firearms. Certain establishments primarily serving alcohol are off-limits for open carry.

### Concealed Carry

Kentucky has adopted permitless carry, allowing concealed carry for individuals aged 21 and older who can legally possess a firearm. However, individuals wishing to carry concealed outside of Kentucky must obtain a Concealed Carry of Deadly Weapons (CCDW) license. The CCDW license covers not only handguns but also knives, clubs, blackjacks, nunchaku, shuriken, and brass knuckles. A state-approved firearms training course is required to obtain a CCDW license, which is available to residents and military personnel stationed in Kentucky but not to non-residents. Kentucky recognizes all valid concealed carry permits issued by other U.S. jurisdictions.

### Use of Physical Force

#### Self-Defense

The use of physical force is justified if a person believes it is necessary to protect themselves or others against the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force. Deadly force is justified only when imminent death, serious physical injury, kidnapping, sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat, or another felony involving force is threatened.

#### Defense of Dwelling or Vehicle

A person is presumed to have feared imminent peril of death or bodily harm when using deadly force to prevent unlawful entry into their dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle, or to prevent the removal of another against their will from these places.

### Protection of Property

The use of physical force is justified to prevent criminal trespass, robbery, burglary, or other felonies involving force on one's property or the property of another under protection. Deadly force is justified to prevent unlawful dispossession of a dwelling, burglary, robbery, felony force, or arson.

### Self-Defense Laws

Kentucky supports the Castle Doctrine and "stand your ground" principles. Individuals attacked in a place where they have a legal right to be have no duty to retreat and may use force, including deadly force, if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death, great bodily harm, or the commission of a felony involving force.

### Justification and Immunity

A person who uses justified force is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action, except when force is used against a peace officer.
