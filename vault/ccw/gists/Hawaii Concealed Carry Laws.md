# Hawaii Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Hawaii Gun Laws

Hawaii is now a shall-issue state following the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling on NYSRPA v Bruen on June 23rd, 2022. Permits are issued by the Chief of Police at the county level.

An unconcealed carry license is issued only in exceptional cases where the applicant demonstrates a fear of injury to themselves or their property.

To purchase a handgun from a private individual, a permit to purchase, background check, and firearms registration are required with a minimum 14-day waiting period. Firearms and ammunition must be registered with the chief of police of the county of residence, business, or temporary lodging.

Possession of firearms and ammunition is restricted to one's place of residence, business, or lodging, but transportation in an enclosed container from purchase location to home, business, lodging, repair facility, police station, licensed dealer, firearms show, exhibit, or target range is permitted.

Non-residents transporting firearms to Hawaii must possess a hunting license, shooting preserve permit, or written invitation for target shooting and register firearms at a police station within 72 hours of arrival. Each firearm requires fingerprinting and photographing.

Hawaii permits open and concealed carry of handguns with a state-issued license valid only in the issuing county. Minimum age for a license is 21 years. Carrying a loaded firearm without a license, including in vehicles, is a class B felony. License applicants must complete a state-approved firearms training course.

Hawaii does not issue non-resident licenses nor recognize CCW licenses from other states.

  

## Use of Force in Self-Protection

A person acting in self-defense may use force they believe necessary under the circumstances without retreating, surrendering, or abstaining from lawful action.

Deadly force is not justified if safe retreat or surrender is possible, except within one's dwelling or place of work if not the initial aggressor.

  

## Self-Defense

Hawaii follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing defense within oneâ€™s home or business without a duty to retreat. Outside these locations, retreat is required if safe.

  

## Use of Force for the Protection of Others

Force may be used to protect others if the actor believes the person could use such force and intervention is necessary.

Similar retreat requirements apply as in self-defense.

## Use of Force for the Protection of Property

Force is justifiable to prevent unlawful entry, trespass, or theft of property in the actorâ€™s possession.

Deadly force is justified against those committing burglary, robbery, or threatening with deadly force, or if lesser force would endanger the actor or others.

Each firearm requires an individual permit to acquire. You may be required to purchase the firearm before obtaining your permit, but you cannot pick up your firearm immediately.

The permit application form shall include:

  

*   The applicant's name, address, gender, height, weight, date of birth, place of birth, country of citizenship, social security number, alien or admission number.
*   Information regarding the applicant's mental health history.
*   Any aliases or other names previously used by the applicant.
*   Information that is or may be relevant in determining whether the applicant is disqualified under section 134-7 from the ownership, possession, or control of a firearm.
*   Information that is or may be relevant in determining whether the applicant lacks the essential character or temperament necessary to be entrusted with a firearm as set forth in subsection (e).

The application process requires the fingerprinting and photographing of the applicant by the police department of the county of registration; provided that where fingerprints and a photograph are already on file with the department, these may be waived.

An applicant for a permit shall:

  

*   Sign a waiver at the time of application, allowing the chief of police of the county issuing the permit or a designee of the chief of police access to all records that have a bearing on the mental health of the applicant.
*   Identify any health care providers who possess or may possess the records described above.

The chief of police of the respective counties shall issue permits to acquire firearms to:

*   Citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents of the United States of the age of twenty-one years or more.
*   Duly accredited official representatives of foreign nations.
*   Duly commissioned law enforcement officers of the State who are aliens; provided that any law enforcement officer who is the owner of a firearm and who is an alien shall transfer ownership of the firearm within forty-eight hours after termination of employment from a law enforcement agency.
*   Aliens of the age of eighteen years or more for use of rifles and shotguns for a period not exceeding sixty days, upon a showing that the alien has first procured a hunting license under chapter 183D, part II.
*   Aliens of the age of twenty-one years or more for use of firearms for a period not exceeding six months, upon a showing that the alien is in training for a specific organized sport-shooting contest to be held within the permit period.

There is a 40-day waiting period to pick up your Permit to Acquire. After you have your permit, you can pick up your firearm. Your Permit to Acquire will only be valid for 10 days from the date it is issued. If this permit expires, you must reapply for a permit.
