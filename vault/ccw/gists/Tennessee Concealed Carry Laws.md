# Tennessee Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Tennessee Gun Laws

Tennessee operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons permits, managed at the state level by the Department of Safety & Homeland Security.

### Purchase and Carry Regulations

No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required for purchasing a handgun from a private individual in Tennessee.

### Permitless Carry Law

As of July 1, 2021, Tennessee allows permitless open and concealed carry for individuals aged 18 and older who can legally possess a handgun, under specific conditions and in places where they have a legal right to be. Certain locations, such as government buildings and schools, remain off-limits.

### Legal Developments

In April 2021, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) challenged Tennesseeâ€™s restrictions on concealed carry for 18- to 20-year-olds. On January 23, 2023, an agreed court order deemed these restrictions unconstitutional and they are no longer enforced.

### Concealed Handgun Carry Permits (HCP)

Senate Bill 705, effective January 1, 2020, introduced two types of Tennessee concealed handgun carry permits:

*   **Concealed Handgun Carry Permit (CHCP)**: Requires a 90-minute online course.
*   **Enhanced Handgun Carry Permit (EHCP)**: Requires an 8-hour live training course and allows both open and concealed carry in more locations.

Non-residents who regularly work in Tennessee and hold a valid concealed carry permit in their home state can apply for a Tennessee HCP after six months of employment.

### Reciprocity

Tennessee honors all concealed carry permits issued by other states.

### Self-Defense Laws

#### Defense of Third Person

A person may use force to protect a third party from unlawful force if they reasonably believe itâ€™s necessary.

#### Defense of Property

Property owners can use force to prevent trespass or unlawful interference, but deadly force is justified only under specific circumstances defined by law.

#### Definitions

*   **Dwelling**: Includes any structure designed for human use, temporary or permanent.
*   **Residence**: A dwelling where a person resides or visits as a guest, including surrounding property.
*   **Vehicle**: A self-propelled motorized vehicle for public highway use.

### Self-Defense Rights

Tennessee implements Castle Doctrine principles and a "stand your ground" law. Individuals lawfully present and not engaged in illegal activities have no duty to retreat before using force likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, under specified conditions.

**Duty to Inform Officer You're Carrying?**

Does Tennessee have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)? Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Tennessee, except municipalities may regulate:

Prohibited areas must be posted with appropriately worded signs in prominent locations or portions of the property or building where weapon possession is prohibited or restricted. Concealed Handgun Carry Permit holders are subject to this prohibition, although a property owner may make an exception for a handgun to be carried in a concealed manner by a person authorized to do so.

A permit holder must have the permit in the holder's immediate possession at all times when carrying a handgun in a location or manner that would be prohibited if not for the person's status as either as a concealed handgun carry permit holder or as an enhanced handgun carry permit holder and must display the permit on demand of a law enforcement officer under such circumstances. \[Tennessee Code Annotated Â§ 39-17-1309, Â§ 39-17-1310 and 39-17-1311(b)(1)(H) and (b)(1)(I)\]

Pursuant to TCA 39-17-1351, persons with a valid handgun carry permit may possess a handgun the entire year while on the premise of any TWRA refuge, public hunting area, wildlife management area (including the North and South Cherokee WMA), and private land. For other federally managed properties hunters should contact that specific facility or location. Nothing in this subsection shall authorize a person to use any handgun to hunt unless such person is in full compliance with all wildlife laws, rules and regulations.
