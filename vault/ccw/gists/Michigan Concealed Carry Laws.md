### Self-Defense Laws

Michigan is a Castle Doctrine state with a "stand your ground" law. A person may use deadly force, with no duty to retreat, anywhere they have the legal right to be. Individuals using a gun legitimately in self-defense have immunity from civil liability.

### Use of Non-Deadly Force

An individual not engaged in the commission of a crime may use non-deadly force against another individual anywhere they have the legal right to be with no duty to retreat if they honestly and reasonably believe that the use of force is necessary to defend themselves or another individual from the imminent unlawful use of force by another individual.

### Use of Deadly Force

An individual not engaged in the commission of a crime may use deadly force against another individual anywhere they have the legal right to be with no duty to retreat if they honestly and reasonably believe that the use of deadly force is necessary to prevent:

*   Imminent death or imminent great bodily harm to themselves or another individual; or
*   Imminent sexual assault of themselves or another individual.

*   You have a valid Michigan license to carry a concealed pistol.
*   You've received training in the use and risks of the Taser.
*   The device has an identification and tracking system that allows it to be traced to the buyer (presumably through the darts) when it’s first used.

Not while under the influence of alcoholic liquor (BAC of 0.02 or greater) or a controlled substance, or while having a bodily alcohol content prohibited under this section. "Controlled substance" means that term as defined in MCL § 333.7104. "Under the influence of alcoholic liquor or a controlled substance" means that the individual's ability to properly handle a pistol or to exercise clear judgment regarding the use of that pistol was substantially and materially affected by the consumption of alcoholic liquor or a controlled substance.

*   Mich. Comp. Laws § 28.425k

As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### Non-Resident Permitting?

**Does Michigan issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?**

Yes, only to active-duty military stationed in Michigan or active-duty military stationed outside of Michigan, but Michigan is the applicant's home of record. Also, if a new Michigan resident has a current concealed carry license from another state, Michigan will accept that and waive the 6-month residency requirement.

### "No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced?

**Are "No Weapons Allowed" signs enforced in Michigan?**

No. "No Weapons" signs are not enforced in Michigan.

  

### Preemption?

**Does Michigan have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?**

Yes, the state has preemption over firearms laws in Michigan, except local municipalities may:

*   Prohibit the discharge of firearms or pneumatic guns (with some restrictions on the latter prohibition) within the jurisdiction of a city or charter township.
*   Prohibit or regulate conduct with a firearm or pneumatic gun that is a criminal offense under state law.
*   Prohibit or regulate the transportation, carrying, or possession of firearms or pneumatic guns by employees of a local unit of government in the course of their employment with that local unit of government.
*   Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 123.1102-1104

**Can I possess/carry a handgun in my home without a license?**

### Handgun Registration?

**Do handguns need to be registered in Michigan?**

Although there is no firearm registry, all handgun sales require a Pistol Sales Record (RI-60) form to be filed with the Michigan State Police. There are several exceptions, including, but not limited to, police officers.

### Purchase Permits?

**Is a permit required to purchase a handgun in Michigan?**

Only Michigan residents may purchase pistols in Michigan. A National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background check is performed on all commercial firearm sales at the time of purchase. The Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) may elect to use a valid Michigan License to Purchase a Pistol (received from your local police department) in lieu of a NICS background check. The buyer must be at least 21 years of age, a resident of Michigan, possess a clean criminal background, and be mentally stable.

Those without a valid Michigan Concealed Pistol License will need to obtain a permit to purchase through the Department of State Police.

### Handgun Purchase Process

**How do I purchase a handgun in Michigan?**

Only a Michigan resident may purchase a handgun in Michigan. A NICS background check is performed on all commercial firearm sales at the time of purchase. The FFL may elect to use a valid Michigan License to Purchase a Pistol (LTP) or have the purchaser complete a Federal Form 4473 for a NICS background check. To purchase a pistol in a private transaction, the buyer must have a Michigan CPL or LTP.

**License to Purchase a Pistol (RI-10 Form)**

A License to Purchase a Pistol can only be obtained from your local police or sheriff’s office. You will need a valid Michigan driver’s license or Michigan state ID with your current address listed to get your license. Generally, the background check that is conducted to get an LTP will take between 24 and 48 hours, and you will be allowed to pick up your license after that criminal and mental health record background check has been completed.

An LTP must be used within 30 days of the date it is issued or it will be void. One copy of your RI-10 will be kept on record by the seller, one by the purchaser, and the third must be filed with the Michigan State Police through your local police department within 10 days of your purchase.

## Michigan Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

  

## Step 1

Renewals are the responsibility of the licensee. An application to renew a CPL may be submitted not more than six months before, nor one year after, the expiration of the current CPL. CPL holders will be notified that their license is approaching expiration by their county clerk three to six months prior to the expiration of their current license. CPLs can be renewed in person at the county clerk's office, via U.S. Mail, or online.

**Online** - Those eligible to submit their CPL renewal application online will receive a renewal notice through the U.S. mail from the county clerk that issued their CPL containing a PIN. CPL holders who receive renewal notices not containing a PIN are not eligible to renew online. However, you may submit a completed CPL renewal application, with payment, to the MSP CPL Unit, P.O. Box 30634, Lansing, Michigan 48909, or renew in person at their county clerk’s office.

## Step 2

Download the CPL renewal application or, if you received a renewal notice from the county clerk that issued your CPL containing a PIN, you may proceed to the online renewal page to submit your renewal application.

  

## Step 3

For those not renewing online, you may renew in person at their county clerk’s office or via the U.S. Mail at the address below. Once you submit a completed CPL renewal application and pay the renewal fees, you will be issued a receipt. If an individual applies for a renewal license prior to the expiration of his or her license, the expiration date of the current license is extended until the renewal license or notice of statutory disqualification is issued. A person carrying a concealed pistol after the expiration of his or her license pursuant to such an extension shall keep the receipt issued by the county clerk and his or her expired license in his or her possession at all times he or she is carrying the pistol. The receipt, when carried with the expired license, shall serve as a valid CPL until the new license or notice of statutory disqualification is received.

**MSP CPL Unit**

**P.O. Box 30634**

**Lansing, Michigan 48909**

  

## Step 4

The applicant shall sign the statement on the application certifying that he or she has completed at least three hours of review of the required training and has had at least one hour of firing range time in the six months immediately preceding the renewal application.

## Step 5

The issuing authority shall issue a license or notice of statutory disqualification.
