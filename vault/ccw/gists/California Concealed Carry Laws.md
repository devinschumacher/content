# California Concealed Carry Laws

# California Gun Laws Overview

California has become a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court’s ruling in NYSRPA v. Bruen on June 23, 2022. Licenses are issued by the county sheriff’s office or local police station.

Residents and newcomers bringing firearms into California must report ownership to the DOJ or transfer them through a licensed dealer or law enforcement. The DOJ conducts background checks for all in-state firearm sales and transfers.

### Firearm Sales and Transfers

All firearm sales require completion through a dealer, with handgun purchases necessitating a permit, background check, and DOJ transaction report. It's illegal to sell, loan, or transfer firearms to minors or handguns to individuals under 21. Ammunition purchases mandate a DOJ eligibility check at point of sale.

### Open Carry Regulations

Open carry of firearms in California is generally prohibited, though licenses may be issued by sheriffs or police chiefs in counties with populations under 200,000, valid only within that county.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry requires a California Concealed Carry Weapons License (CCW), available to residents, workers, and active duty military stationed in California. Applicants must be at least 18 years old, undergo an eight-hour firearms training, and adhere to restrictions set by the issuing authority. Many places like schools and courthouses are off-limits.

### Reciprocity and Out-of-State Carry

California does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states.

### Possession and Use

Residents aged 18 or older may carry handguns within their residence, place of business, or private property without a permit. Large-capacity gun magazine bans are under litigation.

### Self-Defense Laws

California operates under Castle Doctrine principles, allowing force without a duty to retreat in one’s home against unlawful intrusions. Stand-your-ground principles apply in public, allowing defense without retreat before using force. CALCRIM instructions permit acquittal based on self-defense in justifiable homicide cases.

These laws are subject to ongoing legal challenges and interpretations, shaping the landscape of firearm regulation in California.

# Handgun Purchase Process

There is a limitation for purchasing no more than one handgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle in any 30-day period, although there are exemptions, including one for private party transfers. On March 11th, 2024, a federal judge struck down the "high frequency" law citing its unconstitutionality. However, the judge allowed the law to stay in place while the state appeals the decision.

Not every firearm available in the United States is legal to purchase in California. If you are buying a firearm directly from a gun shop, all firearms in the shop should be approved. To see a complete list of approved firearms in the state consult the Department of Justice’s approved firearms list.

All firearms purchases, including private transaction, must be conducted through a federally licensed firearms dealer (FFL). The following information is specific to handgun purchases. You will need to provide your California driver’s license, state-issued photo ID or a military identification accompanied by permanent duty station orders indicating a posting in California, to the FFL. Dealers must obtain the purchaser’s name, date of birth, and driver’s license or identification number electronically from the magnetic strip on the license or ID card. Handgun purchasers must also present documentation indicating California residency (a utility bill from within the last three months, a residential lease, etc.).

Prior to the submission of Dealer Record of Sale (DROS) information for a firearm, the purchaser must present a Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) or provide the dealer with proof of exemption (Carry Concealed Weapon License, active duty or honorably retired military, law enforcement) pursuant to California Penal Code section 31700. The FSC is true/false and multiple choice test that is administered by instructors certified by the Department of Justice who are generally located at firearms dealerships. There is a $25.00 fee to take the test. You must score at least 75 percent to pass the 30 question test.

The California Department of Justice website offers both a study guide and a video to help you prepare for the FSC written test. After passing the test, you will be given a FSC that will be valid for five years.

Purchasers must complete both an ATF Form 4473 and a DROS Form. You will either be approved or if you are found to be prohibited from possessing firearms, the dealer must make available a DOJ Prohibited Notice and Transfer Form, stating that you are prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm and the reason for the prohibition from the DOJ. The total state fee is $25, consisting of a DROS fee of $31.19 which covers the costs of the background checks and transfer registry, a $1.00 Firearms Safety Act Fee and a $5.00 Safety and Enforcement Fee. In the event of a private party transfer, the firearms dealer may charge an additional fee of up to $10 per firearm.

There is a mandatory ten-day waiting period after submitting your DROS Form before you are allowed to pick up your firearm. However, that may be extended up to 30-days if the DOJ is unable to determine whether you are a person who is prohibited from possessing a firearm. At the time the purchaser picks up their handgun, they must successfully complete a safety demonstration with it. Your firearm must also have a DOJ-approved firearms safety device, such as a trigger lock or safe, before you are able to pick it up. If you are purchasing a firearm from a dealer this will likely be included in the sale. But if you are purchasing through a private transaction you will need to supply your own. If you do not pick up your firearm within 30 days of submitting your DROS Form the sale will be canceled and you must restart the process.

You may also request a voluntary determination to find out if you are eligible to purchase a firearm in California. This requires you to complete the Personal Firearms Eligibility Check (PFEC) Form. This form must be filed with the California Department of Justice, accompanied by a copy of your California driver’s license or state-issued photo ID and a $20 fee payable by check or money order to the Department of Justice. This form must be signed and notarized by a notary public. Once you have filed your PFEC, you will be notified by mail within 60 days if you are eligible or ineligible to purchase a firearm in the state.

All legal fixed-blade knives must be worn in plain view, except knives classified as dirks or daggers, which cannot be carried concealed and must be carried openly on a sheath around your waist. There is no open carry size limit for legal knives, although there may be local restrictions. Certain knives, including pocketknives with blades shorter than 2 inches, may be carried concealed as long as the blade is folded in the closed position. Switchblades with a blade longer than 2 inches are illegal to sell, carry, and possess in any motor vehicle on public property. There are a number of types of knives that are illegal, including but not limited to ballistic knives, cane swords, billies, blackjacks, sandbags, sandclubs, saps, slungshots, and nunchaku.

# Wear a COVID Mask & Carry?

I can legally carry a concealed firearm in California, but can I wear a COVID-19 protective mask while carrying concealed?

California is one of just two states with statutes against carrying a concealed firearm while wearing a mask (the other being Illinois). However, the law specifies that a person commits criminal possession of a firearm when the person carries a firearm in a public place or on any public street while masked so as to hide the person’s identity (which isn't generally the intention during the COVID pandemic). However, since there is no exemption for wearing a mask for public health or medical reasons, contact your issuing authority with any questions.
