# Montana Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Montana Gun Laws

Montana is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Concealed weapons permits are processed locally by the county sheriffâ€™s office.

No permit is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. Background checks are not required for private sales but are required when purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer, with the exception of Montana Concealed Weapons Permit holders.

Open carry is legal in Montana without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. The federal minimum age is 18 years old, although state law allows 14-year-olds to carry or use a firearm in public under direct supervision of a parent, guardian, qualified firearms safety instructor, or an authorized adult. Some areas, including federal buildings, are off-limits. Concealed carry is defined as a handgun that is wholly or partially covered by the clothing or wearing apparel of the person carrying the weapon.

Concealed carry is legal without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally own a firearm in most locations. A permit is required to carry concealed in portions of a building used for state or local government offices and related restricted areas. HB-102, signed into law on February 18, 2021, eliminated many prior gun-free zones. Although Montana doesnâ€™t require firearms safety training, an applicant for a Montana Concealed Weapons Permit (MCWP) must demonstrate "familiarity with a firearm." Montana does not issue permits to non-residents. Local municipalities can prohibit unpermitted concealed carry in publicly owned and occupied buildings. Montana recognizes permits from states that require criminal records background checks.

## Use of Force in Defense of Occupied Structure

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another when the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent or terminate the other personâ€™s unlawful entry into or attack upon an occupied structure.

A person is justified in using deadly force only if:

*   The entry is made or attempted, and the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent an assault upon the person or another in the occupied structure; or
*   The person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony in the occupied structure.

## Use of Force in Defense of Person

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another when the person reasonably believes that the conduct is necessary for self-defense or the defense of another against the other personâ€™s imminent use of unlawful force.

However, the person is justified in using deadly force only if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

## Self-Defense

Montana is a Castle Doctrine state and has a "stand your ground" law. A person who is lawfully in a place or location and who is threatened with bodily injury or loss of life has no duty to retreat from a threat or to summon law enforcement assistance before using force.

## Use of Force in Defense of Other Property

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another to prevent or terminate the other personâ€™s trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with real property, other than an occupied structure, or personal property lawfully in the personâ€™s possession or in the possession of another who is a member of the personâ€™s immediate family or household or of a person whose property the person has a legal duty to protect.

However, the person is justified in using force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

"Forcible felony" means any felony that involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.

Montana Code Ann. Â§Â§ 45-3-102, 45-3-103, and 45-3-104
