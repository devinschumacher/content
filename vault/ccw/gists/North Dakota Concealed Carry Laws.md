# North Dakota Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of North Dakota Gun Laws

North Dakota operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, with law enforcement possessing discretion in cases involving perceived risks to public safety. The state's attorney general oversees the issuance of concealed carry licenses.

### Handgun Purchase and Carry

*   No permits, registration, or background checks are mandated for private handgun sales in North Dakota.
*   Residents with a Concealed Weapon License (CWL) and non-residents with a valid resident concealed carry license from a recognized state can legally open carry handguns. Minimum age requirement is 18, with certain restricted areas such as bars.
*   Concealed carry is defined as carrying a weapon in a manner not easily observable by passersby. Permitless concealed carry is permitted for both residents and non-residents as of August 1st, 2023. Individuals must carry their driver‚Äôs license or state ID and notify law enforcement of firearm possession during any in-person interactions. Certain restrictions on firearm possession remain applicable.

### Concealed Weapon Licenses

*   North Dakota issues Class 1 and Class 2 CWLs, both valid statewide. Class 1 licenses offer broader reciprocity due to additional training requirements.
*   Active duty military stationed in ND and non-residents with valid concealed carry permits from their home states (with reciprocity) are eligible. Reciprocity conditions may vary.

### Use of Force and Self-Defense Laws

*   Force is justified to prevent unlawful entry or trespass onto premises, or to protect property from unlawful damage or theft.
*   Immunity from civil liability applies when force causing bodily harm or death is used in justifiable self-defense.
*   Self-defense laws allow the use of force to counter imminent bodily harm, sexual assault, or unlawful detention. A Stand Your Ground law, effective from August 1, 2021, eliminates the duty to retreat in places where a person is legally present.
*   Deadly force is permissible in self-defense or defense of others against death, serious bodily injury, or violent felonies, provided it's deemed necessary and proportional.

For more detailed information, consulting legal resources or official state websites is recommended.
