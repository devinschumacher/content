# Minnesota Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Minnesota Gun Laws

Minnesota operates under a generally shall-issue policy for handgun permits, where a sheriff can only deny a permit if there is a substantial likelihood that the applicant poses a danger to themselves or others. Permits are issued by the Sheriffâ€™s office in the applicantâ€™s county of residence.

No permit, background check, or firearm registration is required for buying a handgun from a private individual in Minnesota.

Both open carry and concealed carry are legal with a Minnesota Permit to Carry a Pistol (PCP) or a permit from a state that Minnesota honors. There is no stipulation in the law regarding whether the weapon must be concealed. A federal judge invalidated a Minnesota law on March 31, 2023, that required individuals to be at least 21 years old to obtain a permit to carry a handgun in public, ruling it violated the Second Amendment.

Resident and non-resident permits are available, and non-residents can apply at any sheriffâ€™s office. Permits are not necessary for transporting a firearm, keeping it at home, or in a place of business. Minnesota honors permits from states with similar requirements in terms of reciprocity.

## Justifiable Taking of Life

The intentional taking of anotherâ€™s life is legal in Minnesota only if necessary to prevent great bodily harm or death to oneself or others, or to prevent the commission of a felony in oneâ€™s home.

\[Minn. Stat. Â§Â§ 609.06 & 609.065\]

  

## Self-Defense

Minnesota law imposes a duty to retreat, allowing the use of deadly force only as a last resort when feeling threatened. While Minnesota does not have a Castle Doctrine law explicitly, it recognizes similar principles. Deadly force is permissible if there is a reasonable belief of great bodily harm, death, or to prevent a felony in oneâ€™s home.

## Authorized Use of Force

Reasonable force can be used in various circumstances or when reasonably believed to exist, including:

*   Resisting or aiding in the resistance of an offense against oneself.
*   Protecting lawful possession of property.
*   Lawful authority over a child or pupil for restraint or correction.
*   School employees or bus drivers to prevent harm to others.
*   Common carriers expelling passengers who refuse lawful requirements with regard to personal safety.

After your application has been submitted, your local police chief or county sheriffâ€™s office will run a background check. Generally, this process takes 7 days to complete.

Upon clearing the background check, you will be issued a Permit to Purchase/Transfer a Firearm through the mail, which will be valid for 1 year from the date it is issued.

You will still be required to pass a background check before making a purchase. A gun shop may charge for this service. Not every gun shop in the state will process permit applications, per their own discretion.
