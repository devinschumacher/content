# Alaska Concealed Carry Laws

# Summary of Alaska Gun Laws

Alaska is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. There is no firearms registration, no permit is required to purchase firearms, and no background check is required to buy a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry is legal in Alaska for anyone legally allowed to possess a firearm. The minimum age to open carry is 21. Some areas are off-limits, including K-12 schools and any place where intoxicating liquor is sold for on-site consumption.

Concealed carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years old who can legally possess a firearm; a permit is not required. Residents seeking to be exempt from background checks when purchasing additional firearms or wanting to carry a firearm in other states can obtain a concealed handgun permit for use in states with which Alaska has a reciprocity agreement. Concealed handgun permits are issued by the Alaska State Police and require a state-approved firearms training course. Alaska does not issue permits to non-residents. Since Alaska has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

*   Kidnapping;
    
*   Sexual assault;
    
*   Sexual abuse of a minor; or

*   Own or lease;
