# Mississippi Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Mississippi Gun Laws

Mississippi operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state, where concealed weapons permits are issued by the Department of Public Safety at the state level.

### Buying Handguns

No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required when purchasing a handgun from a private individual. However, a background check is mandatory when buying from a Federal Firearms Dealer.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Mississippi without a permit for individuals aged 18 or older who can legally possess a firearm. Firearms must be carried in a holster, sheath, or scabbard that is partially visible above clothing. Some places, such as schools and bars, prohibit open carry.

### Concealed Carry

Concealed carry is legal without a permit for individuals who can legally possess a firearm, provided the handgun is carried in a holster or sheath. While Mississippi statutes do not specify a minimum age for permitless concealed carry, the Department of Public Safety generally requires individuals to be 21 years old.

### Permits

For reciprocity purposes, Mississippi offers two types of permits at the state level:

  

*   Standard Firearms Permit (SFP)
*   Enhanced Firearms Permit (E-SFP)

The E-SFP allows carry in additional locations and requires completion of a firearms training course certified by the Mississippi Department of Public Safety. Applicants must be 21 years old, or 18 with military service, a resident of Mississippi, a non-resident with a valid permit from another state, or a retired law enforcement officer establishing residency in Mississippi.

### Self-Defense Laws

Mississippi follows the castle doctrine and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. Individuals not initiating aggression or involved in unlawful activities have no duty to retreat before using deadly force in places they legally occupy.

### Justifiable Homicide

Homicide may be justified in the following situations:

*   Resisting imminent threat of death or felony in a dwelling, vehicle, place of business, or employment.
*   Defending oneself or others from imminent danger of felony or serious personal injury.

‚ÄúDwelling‚Äù includes any structure designed for overnight occupancy, providing legal protection in civil cases and immunity from civil suits if acquitted in criminal proceedings.
