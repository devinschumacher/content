# Iowa Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Iowa Gun Laws

Iowa is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. There are two types of permits available. Professional permits are issued to individuals at least 18 years of age who are employed in a capacity that reasonably justifies that person going armed. Non-professional permits are issued to individuals at least 21 years of age who meet permit requirements, including training.

As of July 1, 2021, to acquire a pistol or revolver from a federally licensed firearms dealer, an unlicensed person must have a valid permit to acquire, a valid permit to carry weapons, or must complete a satisfactory national instant criminal background check. There is no waiting period or firearms registration in the state.

Iowa is a permitless carry state for both open carry and concealed carry for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun. Iowa will continue to issue Permits to Carry Weapons (PCW) for reciprocity purposes. Per Iowa law, the state resources director is required to promulgate rules prohibiting open carry of handguns in the capitol building, the grounds surrounding the capitol building including state parking lots and parking garages, and the state laboratories facility in Ankeny. The minimum age for non-professional permits is 21 years old and 18 years old for professional permits. Concealed carry permits require a state-approved firearms training course. Iowa recognizes permits from all states and jurisdictions.

## Defense of Self or Another

A person is justified in the use of reasonable force when the person reasonably believes that such force is necessary to defend oneself or another from any actual or imminent use of unlawful force.

A person who reasonably believes that a forcible felony is being or will imminently be perpetrated is justified in using reasonable force, including deadly force, against the perpetrator or perpetrators to prevent or terminate the perpetration of that felony.

## Use of Deadly Force

A person is presumed to reasonably believe that deadly force is necessary to avoid injury or risk to one‚Äôs life or safety or the life or safety of another in either of the following circumstances:

*   The person against whom force is used is unlawfully entering or attempting to enter by force or stealth the dwelling, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using force.
*   The person against whom force is used is unlawfully removing or attempting to unlawfully remove another person against the other person‚Äôs will from the dwelling, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle of the person using force.

## Defense of Property

A person is justified in the use of reasonable force to prevent or terminate criminal interference with the person‚Äôs possession or other right in property and to aid another in the lawful defense of the other person‚Äôs rights in property or in any public property.

## Civil Immunity

A person who is justified in using reasonable force against an aggressor in defense of oneself, another person, or property is immune from criminal or civil liability for all damages incurred by the aggressor pursuant to the application of reasonable force.

## Self-Defense

Iowa is a Castle Doctrine state as well as a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù state. A person who is not engaged in illegal activity has no duty to retreat from any place where the person is lawfully present before using a justified level of force.
