# West Virginia Concealed Carry Laws

##  Summary of West Virginia Gun Laws

West Virginia is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons licenses issued at the county level by the sheriff’s office.

There is no permit, background check, waiting period, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual in West Virginia.

West Virginia is a permitless carry state. Open carry is legal without a license, provided the person is at least 18 years old and legally entitled to possess a firearm under state and federal law. Some areas, including schools and courthouses, are off-limits.

To concealed carry without a license, a person must be a U.S. citizen or legal resident of the U.S., at least 21 years old, and legally entitled to possess a firearm under state and federal law. Individuals aged 18 to 20 require a Provisional Concealed Handgun License (CHL) to concealed carry. West Virginia CHLs are issued to residents and military members permanently posted in West Virginia. As of July 6, 2021, the state issues permits to non-residents. CHLs require a firearms training course in handling and firing a handgun. West Virginia honors all out-of-state concealed carry permits.

## Use of Force Outside of a Home or Other Residence

A person not engaged in unlawful activity who is attacked in any place they have a legal right to be may use reasonable and proportionate force against an intruder or attacker, provided the person reasonably believes that they or another person is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, which can only be prevented by using deadly force against the intruder or attacker.

## Self-Defense

West Virginia is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. There is no duty to retreat in any place a person has a legal right to be if they reasonably believe that they or another person is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm.

## Use of Force Within a Home or Other Residence

A lawful occupant within a home or other place of residence is justified in using reasonable and proportionate force, including deadly force, against an intruder or attacker to prevent a forcible entry into the home or residence or to terminate the intruder’s or attacker’s unlawful entry. This is applicable if the occupant reasonably believes that the intruder or attacker may inflict serious bodily harm upon the occupant or others in the home or residence, or if the occupant reasonably believes that the intruder or attacker intends to commit a felony in the home or residence and that deadly force is necessary.

A lawful occupant within a home or other place of residence does not have a duty to retreat from an intruder or attacker.

## Civil Immunity

The justified use of reasonable and proportionate force under this section constitutes a full and complete defense to any civil action brought by an intruder or attacker against a person using such force.
