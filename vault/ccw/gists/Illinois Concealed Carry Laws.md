# Illinois Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Illinois Gun Laws

Illinois operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry licenses (CCL). The Illinois State Police must issue a CCL if the applicant meets specific qualifications. However, law enforcement retains the right to object to a license issuance if they believe the applicant poses a danger to public safety or themselves. The Concealed Carry Licensing Review Board adjudicates objections, making final decisions notified to applicants via mail. There exists an appeal process for decisions.

Open carry of handguns on person or in vehicles is prohibited in Illinois.

## Concealed Carry License (CCL) Requirements

An Illinois Concealed Carry License (CCL) is mandatory for concealed carry within the state. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and complete a 16-hour firearms training course from a state-approved instructor for new applications. Non-resident licenses are limited to residents of specific states. Illinois does not recognize CCW licenses from other states.

## Firearm Owners Identification Card (FOID) Requirements

Illinois residents must possess a Firearm Owners Identification Card (FOID) to legally own firearms or ammunition. FOID card holders, without a CCL, may carry unloaded firearms in a case. Applicants must be 21 years old or have a parent or guardian sponsor.

## COVID-19 Pandemic Response

During Illinois' COVID-19 disaster proclamation, FOID card and CCL renewal applications remain valid until 18 months post-proclamation termination, despite non-submission before expiration. CCL holders need not immediately submit proof of a three-hour training renewal but must within 18 months post-proclamation end.

## Self-Defense Laws in Illinois

Illinois upholds the Castle Doctrine, relieving individuals of the legal obligation to retreat if threatened, justifying deadly force when necessary against imminent death, great bodily harm, or forcible felonies.

## Use of Force Laws

### Defense of Person

Individuals may use force to defend against imminent unlawful force but may only use deadly force to prevent imminent death, great bodily harm, or forcible felonies.

### Defense of Other Property

Justified force may prevent trespass or interference with property, with deadly force permissible only to prevent forcible felonies.

### Defense of Dwelling

Force may prevent unlawful entry or attack on a dwelling, allowing deadly force if entry is violent or to prevent a felony.

## Assault Weapons Ban

Illinois prohibits the delivery, sale, possession, or purchase of assault weapons, .50 caliber rifles, or cartridges, effective 300 days after the law's enactment unless registered with the Illinois State Police.

Assault weapons are defined broadly, encompassing specific firearm features and capacities.
