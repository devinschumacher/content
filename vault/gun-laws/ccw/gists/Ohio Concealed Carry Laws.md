# Ohio Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Ohio Gun Laws

### General Overview

Ohio is a shall-issue state where concealed handgun licenses are issued at the county level by a county sheriff. No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

### Open and Concealed Carry

Open carry and concealed carry are legal without a permit. As of June 12, 2022, individuals 21 years or older who are not prohibited from carrying or possessing a handgun are no longer required to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun. Since open carry is not addressed in state statutes, the Federal minimum age of 18 for possession of a handgun applies. According to the Ohio Attorney General, it is legal to possess a loaded firearm in a vehicle, though this is not specifically addressed in the Constitutional Carry bill.

### Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

Residents can still obtain a CHL. They must complete eight hours of firearms training and meet other criteria to qualify. Current and former servicemen and women can obtain an Ohio CHL without paying the fee or attending a concealed carry class. Active duty military with a valid military identification card and documentation of successful firearms training that meets or exceeds Ohio's requirements do not need to obtain an Ohio license. Non-residents can obtain a CHL if they work in Ohio. Ohio will honor permits issued by any state or jurisdiction.

### Immunity from Civil Liability

Ohio‚Äôs self-defense laws presume that a person has acted in defense of another or self-defense when applying deadly force if that person is in a place where they lawfully have a right to be. Therefore, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person‚Äôs residence.

### Self-Defense

Ohio adheres to the Castle Doctrine and, following the Governor‚Äôs signing of SB 175 on January 4, 2021, is now a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù state. There is no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person‚Äôs residence, provided the person is in a place they have the lawful right to be. A person must have a real belief that they were in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm and that the use of deadly force was the only way to escape the danger. Deadly force may only be used to protect against serious bodily harm or death.

### Driver's License Linked to Carry License?

**Answer:** Yes. Your Ohio driver‚Äôs license is linked to your Ohio concealed handgun license. Therefore, a law enforcement officer will be notified immediately that you are a concealed carry license holder if they run your driver‚Äôs license.

### "No Weapons Allowed" Signs Enforced?

**Question:** Are "No Weapons Allowed" signs enforced in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes. The person in control of private premises, and a private person leasing premises owned by the state, the United States, or a political subdivision of the state, may post a sign prohibiting firearms on or onto that land or those premises. For locations designated as off-limits even with a valid permit/license, posted signs must contain a statement in substantially the following form: "Unless otherwise authorized by law, pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, no person shall knowingly possess, have under the person's control, convey, or attempt to convey a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance onto these premises."

**Question:** Does Ohio have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?

In addition to any other basis, the other person's belief may be based on words or conduct of the offender that are directed at or identify a corporation, association, or other organization that employs the other person or to which the other person belongs. No person, while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought about by serious provocation by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force, shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another or to another‚Äôs unborn by means of a deadly weapon.

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?

**Question:** Does Ohio have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?

**Answer:** Not while consuming beer or intoxicating liquor or under the influence of alcohol or a drug of abuse. As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

5 years

## Processing Time

45 days

## Application

[Link to application](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Forms/Forms-for-Law-Enforcement/Concealed-Carry-License-and-Renewal-Application.aspx)

## Non-Resident Concealed Carry Licenses

Granted only for non-residents who are employed in Ohio. The process is the same as for residents.

## Name/Address Changes

Ohio law requires you to notify the county sheriff‚Äôs office at which you obtained your concealed carry license within 45 days after a change of address. This process, required by law, modifies the record held by our agency in the event you need to be contacted regarding suspension, revocation, or administrative purposes. If you wish to obtain a CCW license with your new address and/or name change you may do so by scheduling an appointment. Some counties have a change of address form, but that varies. A $15 fee is required.

## Lost/Stolen Licenses

Your county sheriff must be notified within 45 days that your license has been lost or stolen. He or she will also require a police report that states you have reported your license stolen or missing. The replacement fee is $15.

## Residency Changes

Moving to Ohio and interested in applying for a resident license? How soon can you apply?

Ohio issues licenses to residents and only non-residents who are employed in Ohio. You can apply for your license to a county sheriff once you have been an Ohio resident for at least 45 days or, if you live in another state, once employed in Ohio. An Ohio resident may carry a concealed handgun under the license of another state within Ohio as long as there is a valid reciprocity agreement with that state. However, an Ohio resident carrying the license of another state without a reciprocity agreement must obtain an Ohio license within 6 months of becoming an Ohio resident.

Moving from Ohio and have an Ohio resident license? Does that license transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your Ohio license remains valid?

If a person with an Ohio concealed handgun license establishes residency in another state, the license expires upon the establishment of residence in the other state. For out-of-state license holders, licenses cannot be renewed once you are no longer employed in the state.

## Ohio Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

## How Do I Renew My Concealed Carry License?

**Step 1:** Renewals are the responsibility of the licensee. Renewal applications can be submitted at any time prior to or after the expiration of your current CCW license. Non-residents must still be employed in Ohio to renew a license and must go to the county where they applied for their initial permits. If no longer employed in Ohio, your CCW license is valid until the expiry date. If your license has expired, you are prohibited from carrying a concealed weapon until you receive your renewal license from the Sheriff.

**Step 2:** Download the application.

**Step 3:** Make an appointment and take the following documents to a county sheriff‚Äôs office:

*   Completed, but unsigned, application form (you will sign it there in the presence of the Sheriff‚Äôs Office Notary);
*   Ohio CHL; and
*   A valid picture identification card (driver‚Äôs license, state identification card, retired law enforcement or corrections identification card, or military identification card only).

Certify that you have read the Ohio Concealed Carry Laws and License Application manual.

Pay the fee.

**Step 4:** You will be notified within 45 days if your application has been approved.

## FAQ:¬†Ohio¬†Concealed Carry Questions

## Wear A COVID Mask & Carry?

**Question:** Can I wear a COVID-19 protective mask while carrying a concealed firearm in Ohio?

**Answer:** There is no known statute in Ohio making it illegal to wear a COVID mask while carrying concealed. One state law makes it illegal to commit a misdemeanor while wearing a mask, however, it does not address wearing a mask while legally carrying a concealed firearm. Geauga County Sheriff Scott Hildenbrand has indicated that it is not illegal for a valid CCW holder to carry a weapon while wearing a mask.

## Carry While Gun Hunting?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes. A person possessing a valid concealed handgun license may carry a concealed handgun while hunting, but it may not be used to shoot, shoot at, or kill any wild animal.

## Carry While Bow Hunting?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes, with a valid Ohio Concealed Handgun License, a concealed handgun license from a state that Ohio honors, or LEOSA.

## Hunter Harassment Law?

**Question:** Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes. No person shall purposely prevent or attempt to prevent any person from lawfully hunting, trapping, or fishing for a wild animal.

## What Are The Knife Laws In Ohio?

**Answer:** Based on SB 140, which took effect on April 12, 2021, any knife or cutting instrument is defined as a weapon only if it is used as a weapon. The legislation no longer categorizes a concealed knife, razor, or cutting instrument as a "deadly weapon" or "weapon" as long as it's not used as a weapon. Ohio law now allows for the ownership, open carry, and concealed carry of any type of knife other than ballistic knives, which are forbidden. Knives are restricted in "School Safety Zones," which include schools, school buildings, school premises, school activities, and school buses, and courthouses or other structures in which a courtroom is located. Ohio municipalities may have additional restrictions. For example, both Akron and Cleveland prohibit the possession in public places of any knife with a blade 2 ¬Ω inches or longer.
