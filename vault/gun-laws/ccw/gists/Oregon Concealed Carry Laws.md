# Oregon Concealed Carry Laws

## Oregon Gun Laws

Oregon's gun laws cover various aspects of firearm possession, open carry, concealed carry, and use of force.

  

### Concealed Carry

Oregon is a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits (CHLs), processed at the county level by the sheriff’s office. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and demonstrate handgun competence through training or military experience. Non-residents from contiguous states can also apply.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Oregon without a permit, though local jurisdictions can impose restrictions. The minimum age for open carry is 18 years old. Certain locations, like federal facilities, are off-limits.

### Firearm Purchases and Transfers

No license is required for firearm purchases, but private-party transfers must go through a licensed dealer with a background check. Records of dealer sales are kept for five years by the Oregon State Police.

### Use of Force

Oregon law allows the use of physical force for self-defense or defense of others against unlawful force. Deadly force is justified to prevent certain felonies or in defense against deadly threats, without a duty to retreat in public areas.

### Use of Deadly Force

Deadly force can be used to prevent specific felonies or imminent deadly threats, but only in defense of oneself or others.

Oregon's laws do not explicitly include a Castle Doctrine or stand-your-ground provision, but they affirm the right to self-defense with necessary force.
