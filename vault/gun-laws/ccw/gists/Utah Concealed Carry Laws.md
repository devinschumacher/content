# Utah Concealed Carry Laws

## ¬†Summary of Utah Gun Laws

Utah is a shall-issue state. Permits are issued by the Bureau of Criminal Identification.

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual. However, Salt Lake County has established a policy requiring background checks for private sales at the county's three event facilities: Salt Palace Convention Center, Mountain America Expo Center, and Salt Lake County Equestrian Park.

On March 24, 2022, Governor Spencer Cox signed SB 115 into law, giving the state greater control over gun laws in Utah. This law allows the state to override policies established by local authorities, including the Salt Lake County policy enacted in 2019. The law went into effect on July 1, 2022.

As of May 5, 2021, following Governor Cox‚Äôs signing of HB 60, both open carry and concealed carry of a loaded firearm are legal for individuals at least 21 years old who can lawfully possess a firearm. Utah Concealed Firearm Permits (CFP) are still available for those interested in reciprocity to carry in other states. Utah CFPs are issued to residents who are at least 21 years old or 18 for a provisional permit. Non-residents at least 21 years old who hold a permit from their home state may also apply. Certain areas, such as courthouses and secured areas of airports, are off-limits. Concealed carry permits require a firearms familiarity course certified by the Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI). With permitless carry, any person 21 years of age or older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

## Self-Defense

Utah follows the Castle Doctrine (referred to as defense of habitation) and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. There is no duty to retreat if deadly force is deemed necessary to prevent a felony from being committed in a location where the individual has a legal right to be.

### Force in Defense of Person

*   An individual is justified in threatening or using force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or others against the imminent use of unlawful force.
*   Deadly force is justified only if the individual reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to themselves or others due to imminent unlawful force or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

### Force in Defense of Property

*   An individual may use non-deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or stop criminal interference with property that is lawfully in their possession, in the possession of a family member, or that they have a legal duty to protect.

### Civil and Criminal Immunity

*   A person using deadly force in defense of property is presumed to have acted reasonably and to have had a reasonable fear of imminent peril if the trespass or attempted trespass is unlawful, violent, or for the purpose of committing a forcible felony.

## Force in Defense of Habitation

*   An individual is justified in using force to prevent or terminate unlawful entry or attack upon their habitation. Deadly force is justified if:
*   The entry is made in a violent or stealthy manner, and the individual believes it is for the purpose of assaulting or causing personal violence, or
*   The entry is for the purpose of committing a felony, and the individual believes force is necessary to prevent the felony.

## Deadly Force in Defense of Persons on Real Property

*   An individual may use deadly force to defend persons on real property other than their habitation if:
*   They are in lawful possession of the property,
*   They reasonably believe the force is necessary to prevent or terminate trespass,
*   The trespass involves violence or is for the purpose of committing violence or a forcible felony that poses imminent danger.

## Driver's License Linked to Carry Permit?

**Question:**¬†Is my Utah driver‚Äôs license linked to my Utah carry permit?

**Answer:**¬†No definition of brandishing was found in Utah law. However, it is illegal to draw or exhibit a dangerous weapon in the presence of two or more persons in an angry and threatening manner. The possession of a dangerous weapon, whether visible or concealed, without additional behavior does not constitute threatening. A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if they engage in fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior.

## Carry While Using Alcohol or Controlled Substances?

**Question:**¬†Does Utah have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or controlled substances?

**Answer:**¬†You cannot carry a concealed firearm while consuming or under the influence (defined as a blood or breath alcohol concentration of .05 grams or greater) or a controlled substance, outside of your residence or the residence of another with their consent.

**Answer:**¬†‚ÄúNo Weapons‚Äù signs under Utah gun laws have no force of law unless they are posted in areas specifically mentioned by the law as being off-limits. For example, if places of worship and private residences have posted a ‚ÄúNo Weapons‚Äù sign, it is illegal to enter. This prohibition applies equally to concealed weapons permit holders. However, a church or organization operating a house of worship may allow exceptions to the prohibition as they see fit. Owners may not restrict a renter or lessee from lawfully possessing a firearm in the residence. A violation of this section is an infraction.

## ¬†Handgun Purchase & Possession
