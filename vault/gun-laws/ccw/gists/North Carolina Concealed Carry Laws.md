Concealed Carry

Concealed carry is legal for residents with a North Carolina Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) and for non-residents with any valid license/permit. North Carolina CHPs are issued to residents and members of the military permanently posted in North Carolina, and require a state-approved firearms training course. The minimum age is 21 years old. North Carolina recognizes permits from all states, regardless of the age of the permit holder.

Use of Force

A person in North Carolina is justified in using force, except deadly force, when reasonably necessary to defend themselves or another against imminent unlawful force.

Immunity from Liability

Use of force likely to cause death or bodily injury is immune from civil or criminal liability if justified under North Carolina law.

Self-Defense

North Carolina adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and has a "stand your ground" statute. Deadly force is justified without a duty to retreat in any place a person has the lawful right to be if they reasonably believe it's necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.

Use of Deadly Force

Deadly force is justified without retreat in locations where the person has a lawful right to be if there's a reasonable belief it's necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. The lawful occupant of a home, motor vehicle, or workplace is presumed to have a reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily harm under specified conditions.

"Home" is broadly defined to include any structure with a roof designed for temporary or permanent residence, including its curtilage.

\[N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. §§ 14-51.2 and 14-51.3\]
