# Florida Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Florida Gun Laws

Florida operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons licenses (CWL), overseen by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS). Here are key points regarding gun laws in Florida:

**Permit Requirements and Open Carry**

  

*   Florida issues CWLs to residents and non-residents, allowing legal concealed carry of handguns and other specified weapons.
*   Open carry is generally prohibited in Florida, except for limited exceptions such as during fishing, camping, lawful hunting, or at an indoor range.

**Recent Legislative Changes**

  

*   On April 3, 2023, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 543 into law, making Florida the 26th constitutional carry state in the U.S., effective July 1, 2023.

**Use of Force and Self-Defense**

  

*   **Use of Force:** Individuals may use force, excluding deadly force, when they believe it necessary to defend against imminent unlawful force.
*   **Deadly Force:** Permissible if believed necessary to prevent a forcible felony, imminent death, or great bodily harm. There is no duty to retreat in such situations.
*   **Castle Doctrine:** Florida supports the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to stand their ground and use force, including deadly force, when faced with a threat of death or great bodily harm in any place they have a legal right to be.

**Presumptions in Self-Defense Cases**

  

*   In cases involving home or vehicle defense, there is a presumption of reasonable fear of imminent death or bodily harm when facing an intruder unlawfully entering or attempting to remove someone against their will.

## Florida¬†Concealed Carry License Information

  

## Residency Changes

Moving to Florida and interested in applying for a resident license? How soon can you apply? Florida issues licenses to residents and non-residents. You can apply for your Florida resident license once you have registered to vote, made a statement of domicile or filed for a homestead tax exemption on property in Florida. If you have a valid concealed carry license issued in your former home state, that license remains in effect for 90 days following the date on which you establish legal state residence in Florida.

Moving from Florida and have a Florida resident license? Does that license transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your Florida license remains valid? If a person with a Florida concealed weapons license establishes residency in another state, the license is valid until it expires provided you notify the Division of Licensing of your change of address as required.
