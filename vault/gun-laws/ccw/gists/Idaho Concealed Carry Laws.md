# Idaho Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Idaho Gun Laws

Idaho is a shall-issue state for concealed carry. Concealed weapon licenses are issued at the local level by county sheriffs. No license is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, no background check is required, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. Background checks are required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL). However, an Idaho Concealed Weapons License (CWL) exempts the holder from the federal requirement of a background check prior to the purchase of a firearm.

Open carry is legal without a license in Idaho for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including elementary schools and courthouses.

Permitless concealed carry became legal as of March 2020, and allows any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who can legally possess a firearm or a current member of the armed forces of the United States to lawfully carry a concealed firearm for self-defense without a license. Idaho offers two types of CWLs, both of which require the applicant to be at least 18 years old. A CWL covers concealed weapons including any dirk, dirk knife, bowie knife, dagger, pistol, revolver, or any other deadly or dangerous weapon. An Enhanced CWL is available for purposes of reciprocity for those who wish to travel out of state. Some states will only accept the enhanced version of Idaho‚Äôs license. Idaho issues CWLs to residents and non-residents. Concealed carry licenses require a firearms training course that has been state-approved or experience with a firearm through participation in an organized shooting competition or military service.

## Self-Defense

Idaho is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. A law-abiding citizen may stand his or her ground and protect himself or herself or a third party anywhere he or she has a legal right to be.

## Defense of Self and Others

No person in this state shall be placed in legal jeopardy of any kind whatsoever for protecting oneself or family by reasonable means necessary, or when coming to the aid of another whom he reasonably believes to be in imminent danger of or the victim of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, murder, or other heinous crime. The defense of self or of another does not require a person to wait until he or she ascertains whether the danger is apparent or real. A person confronted with such danger has a clear right to act upon appearances such as would influence the action of a reasonable person.

## Defense of Place

A person using force or deadly force in defense of a habitation, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle is presumed to have acted reasonably and had a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the force is used against a person whose entry or attempted entry therein is unlawful and is made or attempted by use of force, in a violent and tumultuous manner, surreptitiously or by stealth, or for the purpose of committing a felony.

## Liability

A person is released from liability when protecting himself or herself or his or her family by reasonable means necessary or when coming to the aid of another whom he or she reasonably believes to be in imminent danger of or the victim of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, murder, or other heinous crime.

### Definitions

**Habitation**: Any building, inhabitable structure, or conveyance of any kind, whether temporary or permanent, mobile or immobile‚Äîincluding a tent‚Äîand is designed to be occupied by people lodging therein at night, including a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as an invited guest, and includes the curtilage of any such dwelling.

**Place of business or employment**: A commercial enterprise or establishment owned by a person as all or part of the person‚Äôs livelihood or is under the owner‚Äôs control or under control of an employee or agent of the owner with responsibility for protecting persons and property and shall include the interior and exterior premises of the place of business or employment.

**Application:**

[Link to application](https://isp.idaho.gov/bci/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/documents/CWLform072016.pdf)

**Enhanced Application:**

The enhanced CWL requires additional training than the standard Idaho CWL. It is intended to allow license holders to carry in more states than the standard CWL. [Additional Requirements for an enhanced CWL](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title18/T18CH33/SECT18-3302K/):

*   An state-approved, 8-hour course attended in-person and not through electronic or other means, that includes instruction in:
*   Idaho law relating to firearms and the use of deadly force, provided by a state-approved trainer;
*   The basic concepts of the safe and responsible use of handguns;
*   Self-defense principles; and
*   Live-fire training, including the firing of at least 98 rounds by the student.

**Non-Resident Concealed Carry licenses:**

Idaho issues CWLs to residents and non-residents. The requirements are similar for both. Contact the sheriff‚Äôs office in the county where you intend to apply. Non-residents with licenses issued by their home state may apply for enhanced CWLs.

**Name/Address Changes:**

Contact the sheriff‚Äôs office in your county.

**Lost/Stolen licenses:**

Contact the sheriff‚Äôs office in your county.

**Residency Changes:**

Moving to Idaho and interested in applying for a resident license? How soon can you apply? Idaho doesn't distinguish between resident and non-resident licenses, so you can apply for a license at any time. In order to obtain an Idaho resident license, you must be a resident of Idaho for at least six months.

Moving from Idaho and have an Idaho resident license? Does that license transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your Idaho license remains valid? If a person with an Idaho concealed weapon license establishes residency in another state, the license is valid until it expires provided he or she contacts the sheriff‚Äôs office in their county.
