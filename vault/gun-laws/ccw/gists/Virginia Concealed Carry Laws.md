# Virginia Concealed Carry Laws

## ¬†Summary of Virginia Gun Laws

Virginia is a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits. Residents must file their applications with the circuit court in their county of residence, while non-residents must mail their applications to the State Police.

### Handgun Purchases

When buying a handgun from a private individual, no permit or firearms registration is required if both the buyer and seller are Virginia residents. However, as of July 1, 2020, under SB70/HB2, all sales must be completed through a dealer who submits a background check. Additionally, there is a one-handgun-per-month purchase restriction in effect, although holders of concealed carry permits are exempt from this limit.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Virginia without a permit for individuals who are at least 18 years old and legally permitted to possess a firearm. However, localities like Alexandria and Newport News may prohibit the open carry of firearms in public buildings, parks, and at special events.

### Concealed Carry

Concealed carry is legal with a Virginia Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) for residents and with any valid state license/permit for non-residents. Virginia CHPs are available to residents and non-residents who are at least 21 years old and require completion of a state-approved firearms training course, as well as demonstrating competence with the firearm. Concealed carry is restricted in certain areas, such as airport terminals and places of worship during services. Municipalities may also ban firearms in government buildings, public parks, recreation centers, and during permitted events. Virginia honors all out-of-state concealed carry permits.

## Self-Defense

Virginia case law supports self-defense, including a version of the castle doctrine and stand your ground in certain situations. There is no duty to retreat, and self-defense is permissible in any location where a person is legally present.

### Defense of Self or Others

Virginia law allows the use of self-defense when a person:

*   Reasonably believes they are in imminent danger of an overt act threatening unlawful force, serious bodily harm, or death.
*   Uses a reasonable amount of force in response to the threat.

Deadly force is only permissible if there is an immediate threat of great bodily injury. Additionally, a person may defend another individual if the person being defended would have been justified in using self-defense.

### Defense of Dwelling

Virginia law does not permit deadly force to prevent someone from entering a home or dwelling. Non-deadly force may be used to prevent unlawful entry. Deadly force is only justified if there is a reasonable belief that the intruder intends to cause great bodily harm or death.
