# New Hampshire Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of New Hampshire Gun Laws

New Hampshire is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Residents apply to the local law enforcement office, and non-residents to the State Department of Justice, to obtain a Pistol/Revolver License (PRL).

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required to buy a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal in New Hampshire without a license for anyone at least 18 years of age who can legally possess a firearm. There is no minimum age to carry a firearm, although the federal minimum age is 18 years old. Pistol/Revolver Licenses (PRLs) are issued to residents and non-residents for reciprocity purposes. No fingerprinting or photograph is required for a PRL. New Hampshire law does not mandate firearms safety training or demonstration of firearms knowledge for license applicants. Due to permitless carry, any individual aged 18 and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

## Self-Defense

New Hampshire follows the Castle Doctrine and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. A person lawfully present in a place threatened with bodily injury or loss of life is not required to retreat before using force.

  

## Use of Force in Defense of Premises

A person in control of premises or licensed to be there may use non-deadly force to prevent or stop criminal trespass. Deadly force can only be used in defense against a person or to prevent arson by a trespasser.

Civil Immunity: Individuals using force in self-defense, defense of others, premises, property, or in law enforcement are protected from civil liability for injuries sustained by an aggressor.

\[N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ¬ß 627:4, 62:5, 627:6, 627:7, and 627:1a\]

  

## Physical Force in Defense of a Person

A person may use non-deadly force to defend themselves or others from imminent unlawful non-deadly force. Deadly force is justified if there is a reasonable belief that another person:

*   Is about to use unlawful deadly force against the actor or a third person,
*   Is likely to commit burglary or forcible sex offenses,
*   Is likely to use unlawful force in a felony against the actor within their dwelling or its curtilage.

Deadly force is not justified if the actor can safely retreat, surrender property, or comply with demands to abstain from acts they are not obliged to perform.

‚ÄúCurtilage‚Äù includes outbuildings directly connected to a dwelling, used for domestic purposes. ‚ÄúDwelling‚Äù includes any place adapted for overnight accommodation, whether or not occupied.
