# Nebraska Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Nebraska Gun Laws

Nebraska is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Permits are issued by the State Patrol Department.

A handgun certificate or concealed carry permit is required for all handgun purchases, including private sales. Omaha mandates handgun registration, but permit holders are exempt.

  

## Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal without a permit for those 18 and older not barred from firearm possession, though local governments may impose restrictions. In vehicles, the firearm must be visible. Open carry in Omaha requires a concealed carry permit.

## Concealed Carry Laws

Residents with a Nebraska Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) and non-residents with recognized licenses may legally carry concealed. As of April 25, 2023, Nebraska allows constitutional carry, permitting concealed carry without a CHP. Minimum age for a CHP is 21, with mandatory firearms training. Lincoln prohibits firearm possession for those convicted of certain misdemeanors within a decade.

## Reciprocity

Nebraska recognizes permits from states with equal or stricter standards.

  

## Use of Force for Protection of Property

Justifiable force includes preventing unlawful entry or property theft.

  

## Self-Defense

Nebraska follows Castle Doctrine, allowing defense without retreat in homes or workplaces. Outside, retreat is required unless defending against a violent intruder.

  

## Protection of Others

Force is justifiable to protect others under certain conditions, with no retreat duty in their dwelling or workplace.

  

## Use of Force in Self-Protection

Justifiable force is permitted to protect against unlawful force, serious harm, or property loss, with retreat not mandated except in certain circumstances.
