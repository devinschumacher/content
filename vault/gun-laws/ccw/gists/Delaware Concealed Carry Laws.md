# Delaware Concealed Carry Laws

## Summary of Delaware Gun Laws

Delaware is a may-issue state with concealed weapons licenses issued at the county level by the prothonotary office. The Attorney General has the discretion to issue temporary concealed weapons licenses to any non-resident whom the Attorney General determines has a short-term need to carry such a weapon in conjunction with that individual’s employment for the protection of person or property.

There is no license required to purchase firearms, nor is firearms registration required in the state of Delaware. On May 16, 2024, the governor signed into law the requirement to have a permit to purchase a firearm. The law doesn't go into effect for 18 months (roughly around November 2025). Private-party transfers of firearms to persons other than family members must be conducted through a licensed dealer, who is required by federal law to conduct a background check and keep a record of the sale. A transfer to a person who possesses a valid Delaware Concealed Deadly Weapon License (CDWL) is exempt from this requirement.

Open carry is legal in Delaware for anyone over 21 who can legally possess a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and detention facilities.

Concealed carry is legal in Delaware for residents with a CDWL and non-residents with a CCW permit from a state that Delaware honors. CDWLs are primarily issued to residents, with the Attorney General able to issue temporary concealed weapons licenses to non-residents. A firearms training course that includes live-fire shooting exercises is required to obtain a permit. Applicants must obtain five references from residents of their county and then publish their application in a local newspaper 10 days before filing their application. The application is reviewed by the Attorney General’s office and a court. The Attorney General has the discretion to issue, on a limited basis, a temporary license to a non-resident whom the Attorney General determines has a short-term necessity to carry such a weapon within Delaware, in conjunction with that individual’s employment, for the protection of person or property. In terms of reciprocity, Delaware recognizes permits issued by other states that honor Delaware licenses to carry concealed deadly weapons and afford a reasonably similar degree of protection as is provided by licensure in Delaware.

## Use of Force in Self-Protection

The use of force is justifiable when the defendant believes it is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting the defendant against the use of unlawful force, death, serious physical injury, kidnapping, or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat.

## Civil Liability

Where a person has used force for the protection of property and has not been convicted of any crime or offense connected with that use of force, such person shall not be liable for damages or be otherwise civilly liable to the one against whom such force was used.

## Self-Defense

Delaware is a Castle Doctrine state. There is no duty to retreat in or from your dwelling or place of work. There is a duty to retreat when outside your home or workplace.

## Use of Force for the Protection of Other Persons

The use of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable to protect a third person when:

*   The defendant would have been justified in using such force to protect himself or herself;
*   The third person whom the defendant seeks to protect would have been justified in using such protective force; and
*   The defendant believes that intervention is necessary for the protection of the other person.

There is no duty to retreat unless the defendant knows it can be done in complete safety in the third person’s dwelling or place of work.

  

## Use of Force for the Protection of Property

The use of force is justifiable to protect property provided the defendant first requests the person to desist from interference with the property and when the defendant believes that such force is immediately necessary:

*   To prevent the commission of criminal trespass or burglary in a building or upon real property in the defendant’s possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the defendant acts; or
*   To prevent entry upon real property in the defendant’s possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the defendant acts; or
*   To prevent theft, criminal mischief, or any trespass or taking of tangible, movable property in the defendant’s possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection the defendant acts.

The use of deadly force for the protection of property is justifiable only if the defendant believes that:

*   A person is attempting to dispossess the defendant of the defendant’s dwelling; or
*   The person is attempting to commit arson, burglary, robbery, or felonious theft, or property destruction and either:
*   Had employed or threatened deadly force against or in the presence of the defendant; or
*   The defendant believed the use of force other than deadly force would expose the defendant, or another person in the defendant’s presence, to the reasonable likelihood of serious physical injury.

You may want to verify payment methods at the time you schedule your interview.

**Step 4:** Have the reference questionnaires completed by 5 citizens from the county in which you reside who are not related to you and who have known you for at least 1 year.

**Step 5:** Take the completed and notarized application to the prothonotary office, or mail it to the prothonotary office in the county in which you reside. You will need to include the following:

*   The original set of fingerprints and a complete copy of all the documents;
*   Two passport-style photographs taken within the preceding 6-month period; and

**Step 7:** Submit an original, notarized certification of satisfactory completion of the firearms training course. Please note that if a certification or proof of enrollment is not filed with the court within 90 days of the approval of your gun license, they will assume you no longer want to obtain a gun license.

**Step 8:** Your license will be issued.
