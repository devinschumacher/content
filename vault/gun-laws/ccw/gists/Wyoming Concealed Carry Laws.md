# Wyoming Concealed Carry Laws

## ¬†Summary of Wyoming Gun Laws

Wyoming is a shall-issue state. Wyoming Concealed Firearms Permit (CFP) applications are processed locally by the county sheriff‚Äôs office and issued by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI). Local law enforcement has some discretion in determining whether or not to issue a concealed weapons permit to an applicant.

No permit is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, no background check is required, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. Background checks are required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer. However, a Wyoming CFP exempts the holder from the federal requirement of a background check prior to the purchase of a firearm.

Open carry is legal without a permit for anyone who is at least 18 years old and legally entitled to carry a firearm.

As of July 1, 2021, permitless concealed carry is legal for any legal resident of the U.S. who is 21 years old or older and who may lawfully possess a firearm. The minimum age to purchase and possess a handgun is 21 years old ‚Äî 18 years old for shotguns or rifles. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and businesses primarily devoted to the sale and consumption of alcohol. A Wyoming CFP requires a state-approved firearms training course or experience with a firearm through participation in an organized shooting competition or military service. Wyoming does not issue non-resident permits. In terms of reciprocity, Wyoming honors permits from other states that recognize Wyoming permits.

## Self-Defense

Wyoming is a Castle Doctrine state and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law. There is no duty to retreat, and the law applies at a person‚Äôs home or habitation or any place where the person is lawfully present.

The use of defensive force is reasonable when it is the defensive force that a reasonable person in like circumstances would judge necessary to prevent an injury or loss and no more, including deadly force if necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury to the person employing the deadly force.

A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury to himself or herself or another when using defensive force, including deadly force if:

*   The intruder against whom the defensive force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering or had unlawfully and forcibly entered another‚Äôs home or habitation, or if that intruder had removed or was attempting to remove another against his or her will from one‚Äôs home or habitation.
*   The person who uses defensive force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act was occurring.

A person who unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter another‚Äôs home or habitation is presumed to be doing so with the intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or violence.

## Criminal Immunity

A person who uses legal, reasonable defensive force shall not be criminally prosecuted for that use of reasonable defensive force.
