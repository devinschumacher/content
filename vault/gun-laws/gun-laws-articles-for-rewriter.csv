### Vermont Gun Law Overview

### Permits and Registration

  * Vermont does not require permits to purchase firearms or registration of guns and their owners. Under Vermont firearm laws, it is not necessary to have a permit to conceal and carry a weapon.



### Dealer Requirements

  * All dealers must keep records of all sales of new and used handguns. These records must include the weapon’s make, name, model, caliber, and manufacturer’s serial number, as well as the purchaser’s name, address, occupation, age, height, weight, and hair and eye color. The records must be kept on file and on location for at least six years and made available to the proper authorities if requested.



### Firearm Possession

  * Possession of a firearm is not contingent on obtaining permits or licenses. However, no one under the age of 16 may possess a firearm unless they have permission from a parent or legal guardian. It is illegal to possess a zip gun, defined as a homemade firearm or weapon.



### Zip Guns

  * Zip guns, which can be disguised as other objects, are prohibited and considered illegal in Vermont. This law ensures that while open carry and concealed carry are permitted without a permit, the possession of such disguised weapons is controlled.



### Machine Guns and Automatic Weapons

  * Vermont does not impose regulations on machine guns or automatic weapons as long as they comply with federal laws.

### Maine Gun Laws

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people the right to bear arms. Maine’s constitution also recognizes gun rights, stating, “Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms, and this right shall never be questioned.” However, the right to bear arms is not absolute. The challenge for federal and state governments is to balance concerns for public safety with the right to own guns.

On Oct. 25, 2023, a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, brought renewed attention to the state’s gun laws. A gunman opened fire in a bowling alley and a restaurant, killing 18 people and injuring 13 others. After a two-day chase, authorities found the suspect, an Army reservist, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. This incident has led Maine’s governor to call on the Maine legislature to tighten the state’s gun restrictions, particularly in the areas of background checks and mental health. Whether Maine enacts new legislation in the aftermath of the shooting remains to be seen. Lawmakers often disagree on what changes to firearm laws will help prevent gun violence.

### Federal Firearms Laws

While constitutional provisions take precedence, federal and state firearms laws continue to develop and change. Federal laws provide a structure to regulate the legal manufacture, use, sale, and possession of firearms. The National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) regulated certain dangerous weapons, including short-barreled rifles and shotguns, silencers, and machine guns. It requires the registration of these weapons and others. The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) expanded the categories of persons barred from having or owning firearms. Bans extend to people with felony convictions and misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence, those who are subject to protection orders, and more. Under the GCA, the government will run a background check when a person tries to buy a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer to prevent gun purchases by those prohibited under the law.

### Maine’s Gun Laws

### Gun Ownership and Safety

Maine’s gun laws focus more on gun ownership than on gun safety. As a mostly rural state, Maine emphasizes safety related to hunting and recreational target shooting. Gun control advocates recommend that Maine pass laws supporting universal background checks for gun purchases and consider a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

### Permitless Carry Law

In 2015, Maine enacted a “permitless carry” law, allowing people 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Gun control advocates see these laws as dangerous, as they can lead to people carrying a firearm with little experience or bad intentions. With permit or license laws, the public can take comfort in knowing that carriers had to complete firearms training and pass a background check before carrying concealed weapons. The State of Maine still has a concealed carry permit law, allowing Maine residents to get reciprocity from other states. The Maine State Police, local police chiefs, or sheriffs can issue permits.

### Preemption Statute

Maine enacted a preemption statute that prevents local municipalities from passing firearms regulations in most areas. One exception is that local jurisdictions can regulate the discharge of firearms within their boundaries.

### Firearms in Motor Vehicles

Maine law generally allows people over 21 who are not banned from having a firearm to possess firearms in motor vehicles. Those 18–20 years old who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, the National Guard, or a law enforcement agency typically qualify for an exception. Employers can’t ban employees who have a concealed handgun permit from having firearms in their locked vehicles as long as the firearm is not visible.

### Firearm-Free Zones

As with other states, Maine bans carrying a firearm in certain locations. With limited exceptions, you cannot possess a gun in, on, or at:

  * Courthouses
  * Schools
  * Federal buildings
  * Grounds and buildings of the state capitol in Augusta
  * Establishments licensed to sell liquor for on-premises consumption
  * Correctional facilities and jails
  * Acadia National Park and state parks
  * Private premises, if prohibited by the owner
  * Labor disputes and strikes



### Firearm Safety Requirements for Dealers

Although Maine does not require a firearm permit, it mandates that every firearm dealer in the state offer a firearm safety brochure with each sale. Dealers must post information related to local, voluntary firearms safety programs and offer to show buyers how to use a trigger-locking device.

### Relevant Statutes

  * A person who is an unlawful user or addicted to any controlled substance

  * A person convicted (or adjudicated as a juvenile) of certain domestic violence crimes



### Licensing and Carry Laws

### License Requirements

Maine has no law requiring gun owners or buyers to obtain a license.

### Concealed Carry License Requirements

A concealed handgun permit is not required for people 21 and older who are otherwise law-abiding citizens and are not prohibited from possession by law. Maine continues to provide concealed handgun permits for interested gun owners.

  * If you are 18 to 20, you must have a concealed firearm permit.
  * Nonresidents can carry a concealed firearm if the person gets a permit from a state that accepts Maine’s permit to carry.

### Firearm Laws in Minnesota

### General Overview

Although Minnesota constantly ranks among the safest places in America, the state has fairly liberal gun rights. Minnesota gun laws are neither complex nor revolutionary but instead fairly basic for a Midwest state. Like Michigan, the gun rights towards users of shotguns and rifles are relatively casual. There is no permit, license, or registration required for such firearms. Laws in regards to possession, purchase, and registration are basically non-existent for hunting weapons. Laws do require that these weapons be carried only in areas that allow target practice or hunting. The laws associated with handguns and semi-automatic weaponry are not as lax and should be detailed.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*UmVcdbz7GlGdNVJMx2tkag.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Regulations for Handguns

Under Minnesota gun laws, handguns require a permit to purchase and to carry. Gun rights in Minnesota are strict in regards to purchasing and carrying, but not licensing and registration — licensing and registration of handguns is not necessary.

  * **Permits to Purchase** : Permits of purchase in Minnesota require a few basic restrictions to be met. Once purchased, a mandatory seven-day period takes place in order for gun rights to be obtained. Buyers must be at least 21 years of age; complete an application; not show up in Minnesota’s gang database; be a resident of the county in which the individual is requesting a permit; and lastly, must provide a certificate upon completing authorized firearms training.
  * **Transferee Permit** : In addition to a carrying permit, a transferee permit will allow an individual to purchase a gun legally. This alternative form requires an application process that takes 7 days to review and requires basic information as well as a common background check. All handguns purchased in Minnesota are documented in the state’s system, while long guns purchased will be documented in the federal system. Minnesota gun laws also require a record of sale and a permit to conceal and carry such firearms.
  * **Carrying a Handgun** : Gun rights in Minnesota are strict in regards to concealment. Application for a permit to carry a concealed weapon is completed at the local sheriff’s office. The application is a standardized statewide form and includes basic information along with a list of the applicant’s past 10-year residency history. Applicants must be at least 21 years of age, a US citizen, and pass a basic firearms training course. Minnesota gun laws require a fee of $100 and a 30-day waiting period for either denial or approval of the permit. Concealed weapons (permit or not) may not be brought to places of education, worship, childcare centers, or private property where appropriate signs are posted.



### Regulations for Gun Dealers

Perhaps the strongest part of Minnesota gun law is the connection between firearms dealers and law enforcement. The sale of firearms in retail shops and gun shows are inspected by the police, and security precautions are required.

### Federal and State Gun Control Laws: An Overview

Federal and state gun control laws place limits on the purchase, use, and possession of firearms throughout the country, with state laws varying considerably. With limited gun control legislation emerging from a divided Congress, state legislators must balance concerns about gun violence with the rights of law-abiding gun owners. The majority of Ohio lawmakers favor gun rights over increased regulation, resulting in Ohio gun laws containing fewer restrictions compared to other states.

A major limitation on gun restrictions appears in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the right to bear arms as an individual right to own guns for self-defense and other lawful reasons. In assessing the constitutionality of laws that restrict the possession of firearms, the focus is on whether the law is consistent with regulations of guns at the time of the Constitution’s adoption.

### Ohio Gun Control Laws

Ohio gun control laws prohibit certain weapons while restricting gun purchases and ownership by certain individuals. For instance, Ohio prohibits the possession of:

  * Sawed-off shotguns
  * Zip guns, which are improvised and often dangerous firearms
  * Certain weapons and ammunition designed for military use



The state has not banned assault weapons or sought to regulate so-called undetectable firearms known as “ghost guns.”

#### Prohibited Persons

Under Ohio law, the following cannot own or possess firearms:

  * Certain convicted felons
  * Individuals with substance abuse problems
  * Those found mentally incompetent



Ohio does not require a waiting period prior to purchasing a gun. If you purchase a gun from a federally licensed dealer, they will run a criminal background check using the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) before delivering the firearm. If you buy from a private seller or unlicensed dealer, you are not required to undergo a criminal background check to verify whether you fall under a firearm prohibition.

Ohio law does not provide a minimum age for possessing a firearm. Those under 18 cannot legally purchase a firearm, and persons under 21 cannot legally purchase a handgun, with exceptions for police officers and active-duty military who are at least 18.

### Ohio Concealed Carry Laws

In 2022, the Ohio General Assembly passed a permitless carry law. Under this law, a qualifying adult is not required to complete firearms training or obtain a concealed handgun license (CHL) to carry a concealed handgun in the state.

A qualifying adult must be 21 years of age or older, not prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or federal law, and otherwise meet the criteria to obtain a CHL. Whether you are an Ohio resident or a non-resident working in Ohio, you file your license application with your local sheriff’s office or the sheriff of a neighboring county.

Ohio maintains its concealed carry permit process to assist permit-holders traveling to states that have a reciprocity agreement with Ohio.

Even with laws that permit open or concealed carry of firearms, state law prohibits bringing guns into certain locations. States vary in what locations are off-limits. Private property owners can ban guns from their property but must provide signage. In Ohio, the law prohibits guns in the following locations under most circumstances:

  * Sheriff, highway patrol, and police stations
  * Premises controlled by the Ohio Attorney General’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI)
  * State correctional facilities, jails, workhouses, and other detention facilities
  * Restricted areas of airports
  * Institutions governed by state mental health and addiction or developmental disability services
  * School safety zones
  * Courthouses and courtrooms
  * Permit D liquor establishments
  * Government buildings of the state (including the Statehouse and Capitol in Columbus) and its political subdivisions
  * Premises owned or leased by public or private colleges and universities
  * Places of worship
  * Locations prohibited under federal law



Ohio bans transporting or having a loaded gun in a motor vehicle in a manner that an operator or passenger can access it without leaving the vehicle. There are several exceptions, including one for those with a valid CHL who are not in a prohibited location.

### Firearm Laws in Massachusetts

Comparatively speaking, gun control in Massachusetts is among the most comprehensive and strict. Percentage-wise (population divided by murders), violent crimes in Massachusetts are among the lowest in the nation. Similar to Maryland, Massachusetts gun laws are strong regarding permits and restrictions on dealers, but lack comprehensive background checks for prospective purchasers. The permit and license requirements are incredibly complex and must be analyzed in depth.

Gun control in Massachusetts is strong because of the requirements necessary to purchase a license and permit. Fingerprinting, safety training, testing, waiting periods, and law enforcement are involved in the process of obtaining a permit. Permits are required to both purchase and carry all classes of firearms in the state. Procedures revolving around licenses are much more complex.

### Types of Licenses

There are a total of five licenses one can receive in Massachusetts:

  * **RFID (Restricted License)** : Only permits the individual to carry mace or pepper spray.
  * **FID (Firearms Identification Card)** : Allows only long rifles, mace, and pepper spray.
  * **Class B License** : Permits the purchase of long rifles and handguns with small chambers (no more than 10 rounds). Concealment of weapons is not allowed with a Class B license.
  * **Class A License** : Allows an individual to purchase any legal firearm in the state of Massachusetts with concealment privileges granted.
  * **Automatic Weapons License** : Issued only to law enforcement personnel.



A license of ownership must be present at the time of application or purchase. Class A and B carrying licenses take 30 days to process and require the individual to be at least 21 years of age. All weapons and firearms licenses require applications, fees, interviews, and fingerprints to be conducted at the jurisdiction’s local police department. The integration of law enforcement in the license process makes Massachusetts gun control unique and rigorous.

### Regulations for Gun Dealers

Massachusetts gun laws are perhaps most rigorous for gun dealers. To curb firearm trafficking and the sale of illegal firearms, the state has adopted the harshest laws for gun stores in the nation. The stricter the laws are for the supplier, the harder it is for the buyer to purchase. A simple equation, a dealer must be licensed, keep records, communicate with the state, allow police inspections, and follow numerous security precautions to be considered a legally licensed dealer.

### Overview of Nebraska Gun Laws

### General Regulations

Like many states in the Great Plains, Nebraska possesses a weak stance on gun control laws. Nebraska does not require a license or permit to purchase or possess firearms. Registration for both handguns and rifles is not necessary. The only firearm permit mandatory by state law is for carrying and concealment purposes.

### Handgun Purchases

  * Instead of firearm permits at the time of purchase, Nebraska law requires a certificate to validate such an acquisition.
  * A handgun is defined as any firearm with a barrel less than 16 inches long or any firearm designed to be held and used with a single hand.
  * Application for the certificate can be conducted in person at the sheriff’s office or through the mail.
  * A criminal history check is conducted upon submission of the application. The certificate will be upheld if the applicant is over the age of 21 and is not prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing a handgun (applicant must also not be a drug addict or former felon).
  * Once approved, a certificate will be obtained within 3 days. The certificate does not require a safety or weapons training course and only takes 3 days to process as opposed to 30.

### Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP)

  * Nebraska did not require a firearms permit for carrying or concealment until January of 2007.
  * A CHP will be issued and accepted under Nebraska gun law provided that the applicant:
  * Is not prohibited under Federal Law from possessing a firearm.
  * Is a resident of Nebraska.
  * Submits two sets of fingerprints.
  * Passes a series of eye examinations.
  * Pays fees of about $100.

  * A CHP does not allow for weapons to be carried under the consumption of drugs or alcohol or in the following locations: hospitals, courtrooms, establishments with liquor licenses, places of worship, financial institutions, fundraisers, schools, or sporting events.

### Federal and State Gun Control Laws: An Overview

Federal and state gun control laws regulate the manufacture, purchase, sale, use, and possession of firearms and ammunition. These laws aim to balance public safety and the rights of gun owners to engage in lawful activities such as self-defense.

Federal laws cover the manufacture of firearms and the licensing of gun dealers, restricting the ownership and possession of certain dangerous weapons and identifying individuals prohibited from having guns, such as convicted felons and those convicted of domestic violence.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

The federal government enforces U.S. law through agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). Congress created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to assist federal, state, and local law enforcement in keeping guns out of the hands of those who cannot have them.

Each state has its own restrictions on the purchase and use of firearms under its gun control laws. These laws must be reasonable and consider the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms for legal purposes.

### Oklahoma Gun Laws

Oklahoma is known for its gun-friendly reputation, striving to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use guns. The state has refrained from enacting new gun regulations to address increases in firearm violence, opting instead to expand gun rights in recent years.

In Oklahoma, no license or permit is required to purchase a gun, and there is no waiting period after buying a firearm. If you purchase a gun from a licensed dealer, federal law mandates a criminal background check before delivery. However, private transactions do not require a background check.

While Oklahoma has not banned assault weapons, it prohibits the possession and use of certain dangerous weapons and ammunition, such as sawed-off shotguns or rifles (unless registered under federal law) and restricted bullets that penetrate body armor. Unauthorized use of body armor during a crime can also result in additional prison time.

State law prohibits firearm possession by convicted felons and noncitizens illegally in the U.S. It is also a crime to provide firearms to felons, individuals under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and those deemed mentally incompetent.

Minors (under 18 years of age) are generally prohibited from possessing firearms, except under certain conditions such as:

  * Participation in hunting
  * Hunter safety classes
  * Education and training in firearm safety
  * Target shooting
  * Skeet, trap, or other sporting events and competitions



### Oklahoma Carry Laws

Oklahoma has recently loosened restrictions on both concealed and open carry of firearms. In 2019, the state enacted a permitless carry law allowing individuals 21 years or older (18–20 if in the Armed Forces, Reserves, or National Guard) to carry firearms, concealed or open, without a background check or handgun license. However, individuals must still comply with state and federal laws and risk arrest and prosecution if they fall under prohibited categories.

Individuals can still apply for a concealed handgun license for reciprocity in other states through the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) or local sheriff’s office. Applicants must show residency in Oklahoma, prove it with a valid state ID, and complete firearms safety training approved by the Oklahoma Council of Law Enforcement Education and Training (CLEET).

Oklahoma gun carry laws often provide exceptions for carrying firearms by peace officers and other law enforcement officers on duty, as well as for self-defense, hunting, fishing, educational and recreational activities, judges, and living history reenactments.

### Prohibited Locations

Even states with reduced obstacles to carrying weapons, like Oklahoma, prohibit firearms in certain locations, including:

  * Government buildings used for conducting business with the public
  * Courthouses and courtrooms
  * Prisons, jails, and other detention facilities
  * Public and private elementary and secondary schools
  * Colleges and universities
  * Publicly owned or operated sports arenas and venues, unless allowed by the event holder
  * Gambling locations, unless allowed by the property owner
  * Establishments where the sale of alcoholic beverages is the primary purpose of the business
  * Places set aside by local or state government for an event with minimum security provisions



Exceptions are made for law enforcement and other special situations.

### Gun Control Laws in Wyoming

Every state has its own gun control laws that regulate the purchase and use of firearms. As a state known as the Cowboy State, Wyoming has relatively lenient gun control laws. Wyoming law does not require a license, permit, or registration to buy or own a firearm. The state sets the minimum age to buy a long gun (rifle or shotgun) at 18 and the minimum age to buy a handgun (pistol or revolver) at 21.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Permitless Carry Law

Wyoming adopted a permitless carry law for residents in 2011, allowing residents who qualify for a concealed carry permit to carry without a permit. In 2021, Wyoming expanded that law to cover otherwise qualified non-residents. The state maintains a concealed firearms permit (CFP) for residents seeking reciprocity in other states, and a state permit allows permit holders to forego an otherwise required background check when purchasing a new firearm from a federally licensed dealer.

### Concealed Firearms Permit (CFP)

The Wyoming Attorney General’s office has the authority to issue permits. To apply for a CFP, contact your local sheriff’s office, which then forwards your permit application to the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) for review and a background check. Wyoming is a “shall issue” state, meaning that if you meet all the objective eligibility criteria, they shall issue the concealed handgun permit.

Permits are valid for five years. However, the state can pursue revocation if a permittee becomes ineligible in the future. The DCI maintains a helpful FAQ section on its website, letting local and out-of-state gun owners know which other states’ permits Wyoming honors and vice-versa.

### Prohibited Locations for Carrying Firearms

Wyoming law includes a list of prohibited locations where carrying a firearm is not allowed, including:

  * Facilities used primarily for law enforcement or by a law enforcement agency
  * Detention facilities, prisons, or jails
  * Courtrooms (unless excepted by the judge)
  * Meetings of governmental entities
  * Meetings of the legislature or its committees
  * School, college, or professional athletic events not related to firearms
  * Places that sell liquor for consumption on premises
  * Elementary and secondary schools
  * College or university facilities (unless with consent of their security)



### Assault Weapons, Ghost Guns, and Private Sales

Wyoming law does not regulate the possession of assault weapons or ghost guns (firearms that can be assembled from a kit or through the use of a 3D printer). It also does not mandate background checks for those purchasing a gun through a private sale. There is no waiting period from the time of purchase to the time of delivery when buying a firearm.

### State Preemption Law

Wyoming has a state preemption law that bans local authorities from passing stricter gun laws than the state. The state also passed a law stating that firearms manufactured and not leaving Wyoming in interstate commerce do not fall under federal regulations, although this law has never been tested in court.

### Relevant Statutes (Laws)

Wyoming’s gun laws can be found in Wyoming Statutes, Title 6, Chapter 8, Sections 6–8–101 through 6–8–406, and Title 21, Chapter 8, Section 21–3–132:

  * Use or possession of a firearm by a person convicted of certain felony offenses — Section 6–8–102
  * Wearing or carrying concealed weapons — Section 6–8–104
  * Regulation of firearms — Section 6–8–404
  * Possession of firearms on school property — Section 21–3–132



### Illegal Arms

Wyoming does not prohibit specific firearms but bans the use of fully automatic weapons to take wildlife under its hunting regulations.

### Waiting Period

Wyoming has no waiting period for purchasing a firearm.

### Who May Not Own

Wyoming law states that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a violent felony*
  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a nonviolent felony*
  * *Exceptions apply where they received a pardon or had rights restored under the law.



Federal law states that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have been convicted of any felony in any state, territory, or other jurisdiction of the United States.
  * Are a fugitive from justice
  * Are an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance
  * Have been adjudicated to be mentally defective or been committed to any mental institution
  * Are an illegal noncitizen
  * Have been discharged from the military under dishonorable conditions
  * Have renounced U.S. citizenship
  * Are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of an intimate partner
  * Have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence



### License Requirements

Wyoming does not require a person to have a license to own a gun.

### Concealed Carry License Requirements

Wyoming issues concealed carry permits but does not require them for a Wyoming resident or lawful U.S. citizen to carry a concealed firearm. If a resident is eligible for a permit, they may carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Permits are still available for residents who wish to carry a concealed firearm in states that recognize Wyoming permits.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Wyoming, and no permit or license is required to open carry.

  * Demonstrate familiarity with a firearm through completion of a firearm safety or training course, law enforcement experience, experience competing in organized handgun shooting competitions, or military service
  * Not be currently adjudicated to be legally incompetent
  * Not have been committed to a mental institution



### Machine Gun Laws

Wyoming has no laws prohibiting the ownership or possession of machine guns, except in state game fields or forests. However, federal prohibitions may apply.

### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

Wyoming has few prohibitions against gun possession, but its gun laws do include potential prison time.

  * Possessing a concealed deadly weapon without a permit or other exception is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in prison, a fine of $750, or both. A second or subsequent offense is a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $2,000, or both.
  * Possessing a firearm while having a previous violent felony conviction is a felony, punishable by up to three years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.

This, however, is not the case, as Nevada’s stance towards guns is very lenient. The state does not require any permits or licenses for purchasing or possession. Registration is also unnecessary according to Nevada law. Like most states with casual gun control laws, a permit is only required for carrying a concealed weapon.

### Handgun and Firearm Purchases

  * Many politicians believe that the lax gun control policy in Nevada is utterly ridiculous due to the amount of tourism and temptation Las Vegas offers. This sentiment is backed up by violent crime statistics, as Nevada often ranks as one of the most dangerous states in America in terms of violent crimes, murders by firearms, and assault.
  * Nevada is considered a “shall issue state” and allows for firearms to be carried openly or unloaded.
  * The application process for the right to conceal is not strict. After basic questions are filed at the sheriff’s office, a course and instructional must be completed for the specific model of firearm which the applicant owns.
  * Because Nevada is a popular attraction for tourists, the state honors the concealed carry permits of many other places, including Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Tennessee.

### Regulation of Dealers and Sellers

  * Nevada has more guns sold and registered than any other state in the U.S. The constant flow of people entering Nevada, combined with lenient state laws, allows for this high volume of sales.
  * A gun dealer in Nevada does not need to be licensed to distribute. Records of transactions for sales are not mandated by law.
  * There is no limit on bulk purchases, amounts of ammunition, or magazine sizes.
  * A gun dealer does not have to comply with law enforcement; police inspections of Nevada gun shops are not allowed by state law.



### Crime and Safety Concerns

  * Many gun control activists believe the absence of regulations on dealers combined with the constant flow of tourism contributes to Nevada’s high crime rates. Since 2000, Nevada has averaged 27 gun-related deaths per 100,000 people annually, the highest in the US.
  * The rapid growth of urban areas like Las Vegas and Reno contrasts sharply with the mostly uninhabited lands outside these cities. This dichotomy influences the importance of gun laws differently in various parts of the state.



In summary, Nevada’s gun laws reflect a balance between the state’s cultural context and the ongoing debates about public safety. While the state has made significant strides in regulation, the unique challenges posed by high tourism and contrasting urban and rural areas continue to shape its approach to gun control.

As the state continues to adapt its laws, it remains crucial for stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens to engage in informed discussions that balance individual rights with the security of the community.

### Firearm Laws in Michigan

### General Overview

Michigan, perhaps the state hit hardest by the economic downturn, has actually experienced a drastic decrease in violent crimes. In 1990, Michigan had over 74,000 violent crimes and over 1,000 murders occur annually. Two decades later, those numbers have been cut by nearly 40% and 50% respectively, with 50,000 violent crimes in 2009 and 542 murders.

With a significant increase in unemployment, foreclosures, and poverty, one would expect a similar spike in violence. This has yet to occur in Michigan, and can be attributed to the state’s tough stance on the ownership and carrying of firearms. Michigan gun laws revolve around “common sense” issues, meaning strict requirements for a gun license and permit.

### Regulations for Rifles and Shotguns

Because the state is a popular ground for hunting, Michigan law on guns is very lax in regards to rifles and shotguns. A permit is not required to purchase or carry such firearms, and there is no gun license or registration required as well.

### Regulations for Handguns

Handguns are an entirely different issue, as Michigan has taken a serious stance on pistols and purchasing requirements. According to Michigan gun laws, a permit is required to both purchase and carry handguns.

  * **Purchasing a Handgun** : In order for an individual to purchase a handgun from a dealer or private seller, the buyer must obtain a gun license from their local police department. Requirements for the buyer include being at least 18 years of age, a resident of Michigan, having a clean criminal background, being mentally stable, and scoring at least 70 percent on a safety exam. Within 10 days of delivery, the firearm (unloaded) and gun license must be brought to the local police authorities so a safety inspection certificate can be drawn up. Copies of the gun license will be recorded and held by the authorities for up to six years.
  * **Possessing a Handgun** : According to Michigan gun laws, possession of a handgun also requires strict guidelines to be followed. If an individual is in possession of a handgun, they must immediately bring it to the local police authorities where it will be inspected and recorded thoroughly. During this process, thumbprints of the owner will also be taken so the firearm will be linked to that individual.
  * **Carrying a Handgun** : Carrying a handgun in the state is perhaps the most complex subtopic of Michigan gun laws. A state license is not required for carrying a handgun in the following instances: if the gun is being transported in the trunk of a car, if the gun is being carried in one’s home, or if it is considered to be an antique. Michigan gun laws require that handguns must be empty or in a case if transported. All other instances in regards to carrying require a gun license. In order for a license to carry to be obtained, one must fill an application under oath in front of a county clerk. Fingerprints are also required and administered by the local sheriff. The license to carry is valid for three years and is issued within 30 days of the application.



### Regulations for Gun Dealers

Michigan gun laws are also strict on gun dealerships and distributors. Given its location, Michigan is susceptible to the creation of illegal gun markets and trafficking. Although a state license is not required for Michigan dealers, thorough records must be kept and delivered routinely to the state. Police enforcement is also warranted under law, and inspections are made annually.

### Pennsylvania Gun Statutes

Pennsylvania has relatively stringent gun laws compared to other states. The Pennsylvania General Assembly, which is politically divided with Republicans controlling the State Senate and Democrats controlling the State House, often experiences a political stalemate on gun control. State law maintains several regulations aimed at balancing the right to firearm ownership with laws that combat gun violence.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Gun Purchase Regulations

Pennsylvania gun laws require a purchase application for all handguns bought in the state. All handgun purchases must go through a dealer for a criminal background check via the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS). Sales of handguns, sawed-off shotguns, and sawed-off rifles must be conducted through a licensed dealer or a county sheriff’s office.

While these laws bring Pennsylvania closer to universal background checks for all gun purchases, private sales of standard long guns (rifles and shotguns) fall outside these regulations. Pennsylvania does not require a waiting period before purchasing a gun, nor does it have an assault weapon ban. State law also outlines categories of persons prohibited from possessing a firearm, making it a felony to provide or deliver a gun to a prohibited person.

With limited exceptions for hunting or activities involving adult supervision, minors (under 18 years of age) cannot possess or carry a firearm in the state. Providing a gun to a minor can result in felony charges. Selling or leasing any deadly weapon, cartridge, or gunpowder to a minor is also a crime.

### License to Carry Firearms

In Pennsylvania, anyone 21 years or older can apply for a license to carry firearms. Without such a license, it is a crime to carry a firearm concealed or to have one in a motor vehicle. Exceptions include carrying a firearm at your residence or place of business and for those with a sportsmen’s firearm permit.

Applications for a license to carry (LTC) permit are processed through the county sheriff’s office using a uniform application form prescribed by the Pennsylvania State Police. Details on eligibility requirements are outlined in the relevant state laws. The Pennsylvania attorney general provides information on reciprocity agreements with other states, allowing non-residents with firearm permits from their home states to legally carry in Pennsylvania.

Unlike some states, Pennsylvania does not require an applicant to complete a firearms training course before qualifying for a carry permit. Although the application can be obtained online, applicants must appear in person at the sheriff’s office for signature and photograph.

### Location Restrictions

Pennsylvania law prohibits carrying firearms into certain locations, even for those with an LTC permit. These places include:

  * Courts and court facilities
  * State Capitol building
  * Elementary and secondary school buildings and grounds
  * Colleges and universities
  * Private property with posted signs prohibiting firearms



Exceptions apply to members of law enforcement.

### Second Amendment Challenges

In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen that the Second Amendment provides a right to carry a gun in public for self-defense. As a result, gun laws that burden gun rights must meet a historical test for firearm regulation. This has led to recent challenges to Pennsylvania gun laws with mixed success.

For instance, in Lara v. Commissioner (2024), the federal Third Circuit Court of Appeals found a Pennsylvania law that banned persons 18 to 20 years of age from carrying a firearm during a public emergency violated the Second Amendment. In Range v. Attorney General (2023), the Third Circuit invalidated Pennsylvania’s felon-in-possession statute for a person convicted of a food stamp fraud offense.

In contrast, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld a township ordinance that placed discharge and zoning requirements on indoor and outdoor gun ranges on private property in Barris v. Stroud Township (2024). The court found the ordinances consistent with traditional firearm regulations from the nation’s founding to the present day.

### Gun Control Laws in Virginia

The Commonwealth of Virginia has a long history with gun regulations. Its first General Assembly, in 1619, passed a gun control law making it a crime to provide arms to indigenous people. State regulation of firearms has changed over time. As in other states, Virginia gun control laws limit the ownership and carrying of certain weapons. Virginia laws also restrict who is permitted to own guns. For example, people convicted of a felony or who are subject to a protective order (restraining order) may not own or buy guns.

In recent years, the state enacted new measures aimed at preventing gun violence. This included a move toward universal background checks on firearm purchases and the passage of an extreme risk protective order law. Other laws sought to strengthen restrictions imposed on those convicted of domestic violence and encourage the safe storage of firearms.

### General Overview of South Dakota Gun Laws

South Dakota is considered to have some of the least restrictive gun policies in the nation. The state does not require a permit to acquire a shotgun, rifle, or handgun.

Additionally, firearm owners are not required to be licensed or to register their weapons. The minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm is 18, and minors under this age may possess a handgun with proper permission from a parent or legal guardian. While no application process is needed for purchasing rifles or shotguns, an application is required for handguns purchased from federally licensed firearms dealers. This process includes a 48-hour waiting period before acquiring the handgun. The dealer must submit the application to the local police chief or sheriff within six hours of the transaction, serving as a record for future reference.

State law prohibits individuals with a history of violent crimes, felony charges, or misdemeanor domestic violence charges from possessing firearms. However, individuals with such a history can petition the court to restore their right to bear arms after one year. The court will consider restoration pending an evaluation of the individual, even though their civil rights can legally be restored after that period.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed handguns require a permit in South Dakota. Eligible individuals must meet state possession requirements and additional criteria, including:

  * Being a U.S. citizen
  * Being a South Dakota resident for at least 30 days
  * Not being considered a danger to others or self in the past ten years
  * Having no history of alcohol, drug, or controlled substance abuse
  * Having no felony or misdemeanor convictions related to firearms or substances in the past five years



Permits are issued by the sheriff contingent on the applicant’s background check. Approved applicants may receive a temporary license within five days of application. Permits do not allow concealed weapons in establishments generating over 50% of sales from alcohol, public facilities such as schools, police stations, and courthouses. Transporting a handgun does not require a permit if it is unloaded and secured in the trunk or a case that cannot be concealed on the person.

### Controlled Weapons

South Dakota has special laws regarding “controlled weapons,” including machine guns, short-barreled shotguns, and silencers. Possession of these firearms is illegal unless the individual is a law enforcement officer or a member of the armed forces on duty. Controlled weapons kept for display must be inoperable and registered with the State Law Enforcement Division.

### Overview of New Hampshire Gun Laws

### General Regulations

Like its neighbors, Vermont and Maine, New Hampshire has very liberal gun control laws. However, New Hampshire’s laws are unique in their level of leniency. Most states with minimal gun control do not require a permit or license to purchase or possess a handgun or rifle, and New Hampshire follows this trend. The only restrictions on licenses or permits typically pertain to carrying a concealed weapon.

### Handgun and Firearm Purchases

  * New Hampshire does not require a permit or license to possess or purchase any type of firearm, and registration is also unnecessary.
  * A concealed handgun does not generally require a permit, but specific licenses are needed in certain situations.
  * It is illegal to carry a loaded handgun concealed on oneself or in a vehicle unless the handgun is openly carried, unloaded, or locked in a vehicle compartment. Any other form of concealment requires a license from the chief of police, who will grant the right to conceal if a “proper purpose” is demonstrated. Proper purposes include hunting, target shooting, self-defense, or a reasonable fear for one’s life or property.

### Regulation of Dealers and Sellers

  * New Hampshire has strict policies regarding firearm dealers and suppliers, due to its proximity to Canada and susceptibility to gun trafficking.
  * Unlike many states with lenient gun laws, New Hampshire requires state licenses for all firearm sellers and distributors.
  * Random police inspections of gun shops are allowed, though record keeping is not regulated.
  * There are no limits on bulk purchases, ammunition regulations, or magazine sizes. Background checks, fingerprints, ballistic filing, and even safety provisions for children are all neglected under New Hampshire gun law.

### Texas Gun Laws

### Permitless Carry in Texas

In 2021, the Texas legislature passed a new law approving permitless carry, also known as constitutional carry. Signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, this law allows a person who does not have a concealed carry license to carry a gun in public, provided they are not prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm.

### Comparison with Other States

In other states, including neighboring New Mexico and Colorado, the law requires a person to apply for a license, submit their fingerprints, complete firearms safety training, and pass a background check before the state authorizes them to carry a concealed weapon. In states like Texas, people operate on the honor system. If they engage in the carrying of firearms when it’s illegal, they may face prosecution at a later date.

### Handgun Licensing Program

Texas still maintains its handgun licensing program through the Texas Department of Public Safety. One benefit of getting the state’s license to carry (LTC) permit relates to reciprocity agreements with other states. Eligibility requirements are outlined below.

### Firearms Prohibited Locations

Even with permitless carry, Texans must adhere to laws that ban firearms in certain public places. Some locations where guns are prohibited include:

  * Schools, colleges, and universities
  * Polling places (while voting is taking place)
  * Courts and court offices
  * Racetracks
  * Secure areas of an airport
  * Correctional facilities
  * Certain businesses that serve alcohol
  * Hospitals and nursing facilities
  * Mental hospitals
  * Amusement parks
  * Government meeting rooms



Certain exceptions may apply for active-duty military and law enforcement officers. Private property owners can also ban firearms on their premises, but they may need to place signage to notify customers or visitors.

#### License Required

No. Texas does not require a license to own a firearm.

#### Concealed Carry License Required

No. Texas does not require that a person first get a license to carry (LTC) permit before carrying a concealed firearm. But, it remains against the law for a prohibited person to possess or carry a firearm.

Open carry of handguns is allowed under certain circumstances. If not otherwise prohibited from firearm possession, you may carry a handgun in a public place if it remains concealed or holstered.

There is an exception for college campuses. Under Texas’ campus carry laws, a person with a valid LTC permit may carry a concealed firearm onto a college campus. However, college boards have the right to pass restrictions on such carrying of firearms. Public institutions may restrict but can’t outright ban permit holders from carrying firearms on campus. Private institutions may restrict and even ban permit holders from carrying firearms on campus.

  * Have not made any material misrepresentation or failed to disclose any material fact in an application submitted pursuant to Section 411.174

However, it can become a Class A misdemeanor when the person refuses to leave. This law has exceptions and defenses that may apply.



### Penalties for Illegal Possession on or Near School Grounds

It is illegal to intentionally or knowingly have a firearm on school grounds, school buses, or property where there is a school activity. Exceptions may apply related to storage and motor vehicle rules for a carrier with a valid handgun license or when the school’s written regulations allow a person to have a weapon. Illegal possession on school grounds is a felony of the third degree, punishable by two to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.

### North Dakota Gun Control Laws: An Overview

North Dakota ranks as one of the safest states in the country based on violent crime statistics, with just two firearm-related murders in 2009. Despite this, North Dakota’s gun control laws are among the most relaxed in the United States. Here are the basic regulations for the purchase, possession, and concealment of firearms:

### Carrying and Possessing Loaded Firearms

North Dakota imposes specific provisions on carrying and possessing loaded firearms. It is generally illegal to carry a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle unless specific conditions are met, such as having a concealed weapons permit or being in a security enforcement vehicle.

Carrying an unloaded handgun is permitted one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset, provided it is in plain sight. Concealed carry of a loaded firearm requires completion of an application process.

### Obtaining a Concealed Carry Permit

While North Dakota’s gun control laws are lenient overall, obtaining a permit for concealed carry involves a rigorous process. The application is overseen by the chief of the bureau of criminal investigation and requires:

  * Demonstrating a valid reason for carrying a concealed firearm
  * Compliance with federal firearm possession laws
  * Written approval from the chief of police and sheriff of the applicant’s county
  * Satisfactory completion of a background check and criminal records check
  * Passing an open book test on firearm safety and demonstrating competency in handling firearms, including loading, unloading, and using safety devices

  * A ban on the open carry of loaded shotguns and rifles on public roadways.
  * An increase in the minimum age to purchase firearms from 18 to 21 years.


[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### General Overview of Rhode Island Firearm Laws

Rhode Island’s firearm laws are stricter than those in many other states. Lawmakers strive to balance public safety and the rights of law-abiding gun owners, a challenging task in a country often divided over gun control.

Federal law imposes limited regulations on gun purchases and ownership, overseen by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The ATF handles licensing for interstate firearms commerce and enforces prohibitions on possession and ownership. Federal law mandates that federally licensed firearm dealers run background checks on buyers to prevent sales to felons and other prohibited individuals. The FBI also plays a role in investigating and prosecuting illegal firearm possession cases.

Most gun control laws are enacted at the state level. States regulate issues such as concealed carry permits, open carry of firearms, waiting periods for purchases, and possession or use of firearms in vehicles and public places. States can also impose additional restrictions on who can purchase and possess firearms.

### The Second Amendment and Recent Legal Interpretations

The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states:

“A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Initially viewed as protecting citizens’ rights to defend against an invading army, recent U.S. Supreme Court interpretations have expanded the amendment to include an individual’s right to bear arms for self-defense. In _New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen_ (2022), the Court established a new test for government regulations affecting the right to bear arms. The government must demonstrate that a law or regulation aligns with traditional, historical firearm regulations in the United States. The _Bruen_ case invalidated a New York gun licensing law that gave authorities significant discretion in deciding who qualified for a license. The criteria for licenses must now be objective and tailored to public safety goals. The _Bruen_ decision has spurred numerous legal challenges to federal, state, and local gun regulations.

### Rhode Island Gun Control Laws at a Glance

#### Safety Certificate Requirement

In Rhode Island, purchasing a handgun requires a safety certificate issued by the Department of Environmental Management (DEM). The DEM also oversees the firearms safety course, which includes at least two hours of instruction on the safe handling and use of pistols and revolvers. Completion of this course is necessary to obtain the handgun safety certificate. Local police, other law enforcement, and active-duty military are exempt from this requirement.

#### Concealed Carry Licenses

Rhode Island issues licenses to carry handguns in public, with licensing authority split between local authorities and the State Attorney General’s office.

  * **Local Authorities:** Applicants can apply for a concealed carry permit through their city or town. Under the “shall issue” directive from the _Bruen_ case, meeting objective criteria guarantees the issuance of the license.
  * **State Attorney General:** Applicants can also apply for a license to carry (open or concealed) from the Attorney General’s office, which may issue the permit upon proper showing of need.



Carrying a handgun without a license is a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Exceptions include individuals with valid licenses from other states who are merely passing through Rhode Island and do not intend to stay. Law enforcement officers and active-duty military are also exempt from this requirement.

#### Universal Background Checks

Rhode Island mandates universal background checks for all private firearm sales and transfers. Sellers must submit the application form to the state police, local police department, or another appropriate law enforcement agency for a background check. There is a minimum seven-day waiting period before the firearm can be delivered to the purchaser. Courts must share information about individuals committed to mental institutions with the national background check database operated by the FBI. While Rhode Island does not have an assault weapons ban, it prohibits certain firearms. A state preemption law prevents local governments from passing firearm regulations that conflict with state laws.

### Prohibited Items

The following items are illegal in Rhode Island:

  * Sawed-off shotguns
  * Sawed-off rifles
  * Bump stocks
  * Mufflers
  * Silencers
  * Armor-piercing bullets
  * Machine guns (unless authorized by federal and state law)
  * Firearms with altered marks (obliterated serial number)
  * Ghost guns (undetectable or made by 3D printing)



### Waiting Period

There is a mandatory seven-day waiting period between the application to purchase a firearm and the delivery of the firearm to the purchaser.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

To be eligible for a license to carry a handgun, a person must:

  * Be 21 years old.
  * Have a bona fide residence or place of business within the city or town where applying or have a concealed carry license from another state.

### Gun Control: A Balancing Act in North Carolina

Gun control remains a highly debated topic, whether at the state legislature or in Congress. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, along with most state constitutions, protects the right of citizens to own and bear arms. However, gun violence challenges both state and federal governments to find practical ways to address public safety.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Firearms Law

Although most gun regulation occurs at the state level, some key federal gun laws apply nationwide. Federal law governs the ownership and registration of certain dangerous weapons and accessories, such as machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, sawed-off rifles, and silencers. It also sets licensing requirements for firearms dealers.

Federal law bans the possession or ownership of guns by convicted felons and those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. These prohibitions form the basis for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), used by federally licensed firearms dealers and most law enforcement agencies to help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.

### North Carolina Gun Control Laws

North Carolina’s gun control laws seek to balance the rights of gun owners with the state’s duty to keep people safe. The state does not regulate or reduce access to assault weapons, and in 2023, it repealed its pistol purchase permit law. Here are some key aspects of North Carolina’s gun laws:

#### Background Checks on Gun Purchases

In several states, there is momentum to require universal background checks for gun purchases. Anyone buying a gun through a federally licensed dealer must pass a background check. However, federal law does not cover private sales or transfers. North Carolina had previously closed the background check loophole for handgun purchases by requiring a permit to purchase a handgun, but this law was repealed in 2023.

#### License and Carry Laws

North Carolina generally prohibits carrying concealed firearms, with exceptions for members of the U.S. Armed Forces and certain law enforcement officers. Individuals can apply for a concealed carry permit (CHP) at their local sheriff’s office, which requires a criminal background check.

Regardless of having a CHP, carrying a firearm while consuming alcohol or under the influence of a controlled substance is prohibited. Additionally, there are several locations where carrying firearms is restricted, including:

  * Schools and educational facilities
  * Law enforcement and correctional facilities
  * Government buildings
  * Places where a fee is charged for entry
  * Establishments where alcohol is sold and consumed
  * State Capitol Building and grounds
  * Executive Mansion and the Western Residence of the Governor
  * Court buildings
  * Parades, funeral processions, picket lines, and certain demonstrations
  * Private property with posted firearm prohibition



CHP holders can carry concealed handguns in state parks and highway rest areas.

#### State Preemption Statute

North Carolina has a state preemption statute limiting local governments from passing ordinances conflicting with state gun laws. However, local authorities can regulate the discharge of firearms, display of guns on public property, and the carrying of concealed handguns on certain municipal and county properties.

### Overview of North Carolina Gun Control Laws

The following details the main provisions of North Carolina’s gun control laws:

#### Relevant North Carolina Gun Control Statutes

  * **Carrying concealed weapons** — Section 14–269
  * **Weapons on campus or educational property** — Section 14–269.2
  * **Weapons in assemblies and establishments with alcohol** — Section 14–269.3
  * **Weapons on state property and in courthouses** — Section 14–269.4
  * **Prohibition on handguns for minors** — Section 14–269.7
  * **Firearms possession by persons with domestic violence orders** — Section 14–269.8
  * **Weapons at parades and demonstrations** — Section 14–277.2

### Firearm Laws in Missouri

### General Overview

Missouri gun laws are among the weakest in the country, but this leniency has not led to higher violent crime rates, which can be attributed to the state’s strong culture supporting the right to carry guns. Here is a quick reference chart for licenses, registrations, and permits, dividing handguns and rifles into two groups:

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TMCVgNoKp2NAtvLSAMkaJg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Rifles and Shotguns

  * No permit is required to purchase rifles and shotguns.
  * Registration of rifles and shotguns is not required.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * A permit to carry shotguns and rifles is not required.



### Handguns

  * No permit is necessary to purchase a handgun.
  * Registration of handguns is not required.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * The right to carry handguns requires a license.



Licensing of ownership and registration of firearms is not mandatory under Missouri gun law. State permits are also not required for the purchase of handguns or long guns in Missouri. Miscellaneous restrictions, which outline the use of such firearms, are fairly generic according to the interpretation of Missouri gun legislation.

### Possession Regulations

It is a misdemeanor to possess an unloaded firearm under the influence of drugs or alcohol (it is a felony if the weapon is loaded). The only other regulation regarding possession under Missouri gun law is that it is unlawful for a felon (five years from imprisonment), fugitive, or habitual drug user to possess a concealable firearm. Like many states in the Midwest and Deep South, Missouri gun law is very loose and has very little regulation.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*UmVcdbz7GlGdNVJMx2tkag.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Concealed Carry Regulations

The right to carry guns in Missouri is a little more rigorous. It is illegal to carry a concealed handgun without a concealed carry endorsement, which is labeled on the Missouri driver’s license.

To obtain a carry endorsement, the applicant must be at least 23 years of age, a citizen of the United States, and reside in Missouri for a minimum of six months. Applications to legally carry and conceal a firearm are submitted to the sheriff of the county of residence. The application includes basic information, state and federal background checks, fingerprinting, and proof of weapons training completion.

Once all documentation is filed, the sheriff has three days to issue the certificate of qualification for a concealed carry endorsement. In addition to the endorsement, any state concealment permit will be upheld by Missouri gun laws — the right to carry guns will be considered legal if any concealment permit is shown to law enforcement. Once obtained, the endorsement is valid for three years.

### Restrictions on Carrying Firearms

The right to carry guns, whether concealed or not, is always considered unlawful in airports, hospitals, schools, churches, bars or restaurants, and sporting events. Like most states, Missouri gun law is lax in regard to purchase, ownership, and registration, but strict when it comes to concealment.

Tennessee’s gun laws have evolved over the past decade, reflecting the state’s commitment to responsible firearm ownership and community safety. These changes demonstrate Tennessee’s proactive approach to firearm regulation. As the state continues to adapt its laws, it remains crucial for stakeholders, policymakers, and the public to engage in informed discussions that prioritize individual rights while maintaining community security.

### General Overview of Tennessee Gun Laws

Tennessee gun control laws are considered to be some of the least restrictive in the United States. No permit is required to purchase a firearm per the state’s gun control laws. Any person aged over 18 years is eligible to purchase a firearm, as long it is classified as a shotgun or rifle.

A minor may acquire a firearm on the basis that the weapon is given on loan under permission by an adult, and for the purposes of hunting, camping, or other legal sporting activity involving firearms. However, as per gun purchasing laws referring to the acquisition of a handgun, the purchaser must be subject to approval pending a criminal history background check conducted by the Bureau of Investigation of the state, and administered by the licensed dealer at the time of the handgun purchase.

Furthermore, the licensed dealer must include the purchaser’s pertinent information, as well as the weapon’s make, model, caliber, and manufacturer’s number, which are necessary to complete the background check. If the applicant is void of any criminal history that disqualifies them from being able to make the handgun purchase, the bureau issues the dealer a special approval number, and the buyer is responsible for a fee of up to ten dollars for the background check itself. A background check is not necessary for any transactions between dealers and manufacturers, or between dealers and members of law enforcement.

### Gun Possession Laws

Tennessee gun control laws allow for the possession of firearms without a permit. Those immediately disqualified from possession are convicted felons involving crimes of a violent nature or drugs. Handguns are also restricted to adults over the age of 18 years unless the minor possesses such a weapon for the purpose of hunting and other sports; this includes practicing at an authorized location, attending a safety or instruction course, or if found in a justified situation to use deadly force for the preservation of themselves or others.

### Gun Control in New Jersey

### Overview

Gun control remains a hotly debated topic throughout the country. While the federal government has limited control over the ownership and use of firearms, state gun control laws vary between the individual states. New Jersey gun control laws are some of the strictest in the U.S., reflecting substantial consensus between members of the state legislature and the governor’s office in recent years.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Gun Violence and Public Safety

Discussion of gun control often centers on the prevalence of gun violence. Mass shootings devastate communities, but public safety concerns about gun deaths go beyond the headlines. Recent gun death statistics demonstrate that 54% of gun deaths result from suicide and 43% result from murder. Gun deaths involving children and teenagers saw a 50% increase between 2019 and 2021.

Lawmakers seeking to reduce access to firearms must balance their interest in protecting the public with the rights of gun owners to own firearms for self-defense and other lawful purposes. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution acknowledges a right for citizens to bear arms.

### Legal Developments

In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a New York state licensing system that made it difficult to get concealed carry permits. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Court set forth a new historical test for determining if state regulations placed an undue burden on the constitutional right to own guns. As a result, challenges to gun regulations have increased in courts nationwide.

Most federal laws regulating firearms were enacted in the last century. They include laws addressing the legal manufacture, sale, ownership, and possession of firearms. Certain dangerous weapons, such as machine guns, must be registered and are strictly controlled.

Federal law also bans certain persons from possessing firearms, including felons and those who abuse illegal drugs. Firearms dealers who have a federal license must run a criminal background check on purchasers prior to delivery of a firearm. This helps keep guns from those Congress has determined are dangerous.

State regulations can go further. They can set other restrictions on purchase, use, and possession. States vary in their response.

### New Jersey Gun Control Laws

New Jersey has some of the toughest gun laws in the United States. In 2021, it had the third-lowest gun death rate in the nation. Since his election in 2017, Governor Phil Murphy has made gun violence prevention a hallmark of his tenure in office, signing several new firearms regulations into law including a red flag law and a law requiring private firearms transactions to go through a licensed gun dealer for a background check.

In recent years, the state has also banned assault weapons (called assault firearms in New Jersey) and ghost guns, firearms that are often untraceable. The state’s assault firearms law prohibits possession of the following unless licensed by the state:

  * Certain specific firearms (see list at NJSA Section 2C:39–1w)
  * Any firearms substantially identical to those in the list
  * A semi-automatic shotgun with either a magazine capacity exceeding six rounds of ammunition, a pistol grip, or a folding stock
  * A semi-automatic rifle with a fixed magazine capacity exceeding 10 rounds of ammunition
  * A part or combination of parts designed to convert a firearm into an assault firearm
  * A firearm with a bump stock attached



The Garden State requires anyone who seeks to purchase a handgun in the state to obtain a handgun purchase permit. Buyers must also register handguns. You may only buy one handgun in a 30-day period in New Jersey. To purchase a rifle, shotgun, or handgun ammunition, you must have a firearm purchase identification card (FPIC).

In 2020, New Jersey enacted a law that required the state attorney general to design a suicide prevention course and suicide prevention informational materials. Retail firearms dealers are encouraged to take the course. Dealers must also make the suicide prevention materials available on each retail counter at their gun stores.

In 2022, the state of New Jersey conducted an overhaul of its concealed handgun permit law. Prior versions of the law had required an applicant to show a justifiable need for a permit. This type of discretionary standard was found to be unconstitutional in the Bruen case.

Under the revised law, applicants for a handgun permit apply to the chief of police in their municipality or to the Superintendent of State Police. Applicants must also have the endorsement of four reputable persons who can vouch that they are not likely to engage in acts, outside of self-defense, that would cause harm to self or others. They submit their fingerprints and will be subject to a criminal background check.

The police will interview applicants and those who provide endorsements. Applicants must complete approved firearms training and show proof of liability insurance. Their application must also gain the approval of the superior court before the issuance of a permit.

New Jersey also expanded its law that prohibits the possession of firearms in certain locations. Prohibited places include:

  * Government buildings and offices
  * Police stations
  * Courthouses
  * Schools and universities
  * Correctional facilities
  * Health care facilities
  * Parks
  * Beaches
  * Playgrounds
  * Entertainment centers, including casinos



The law defaults to a firearms ban on private property unless the property owner or place of business has expressly provided consent or posted signage to that effect. A legal challenge to New Jersey’s handgun permitting process and its location prohibitions has temporarily blocked some parts of these laws from taking effect.

New Jersey firearms law provides for safe storage of any gun while in a motor vehicle. During transport, a handgun must be unloaded and in a locked container or gunbox, or locked and unloaded in the vehicle’s trunk. Hunters must likewise keep any rifle or shotgun unloaded during transport in a motor vehicle.

### Gun Violence and Legislative Responses

Both state and federal governments struggle to respond to crime, including gun violence. One of the most horrific mass shootings in the U.S. occurred in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015. A 21-year-old, self-proclaimed white supremacist shot and killed nine church members at a Bible study meeting after going there with the intent to commit a hate crime.

After such tragedies, legislators in some states review their gun laws and try to reach a consensus on changes that could prevent gun crimes in the future. Striking a balance between public safety and the rights of gun owners can be a challenging task.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

Despite proposals for new legislation, changes to federal law have been few and far between. At the state level, it can depend on the politics of the state. Sometimes compromise may be found on gun safety initiatives but not on larger, more sweeping legislation.

Federal law regulates the ownership and use of certain dangerous weapons, such as machine guns and devices like bump stocks, which cause semi-automatic rifles to fire like fully automatic weapons.

The federal government licenses firearms dealers. It also prohibits certain categories of persons from possessing a gun, including felons and those using illegal drugs.

### South Carolina Gun Statutes

States can craft gun control laws that limit the purchase, possession, and use of firearms. In general, South Carolina lawmakers support gun rights over gun regulations. They point to the Second Amendment right to bear arms as a key limitation on firearm restrictions.

Recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court have interpreted the Second Amendment as providing an individual right to own guns for self-defense and other lawful purposes. As a result, gun rights advocates have brought more Second Amendment challenges to state and federal gun regulations.

South Carolina does not require a permit or license to purchase or own a firearm. The state has no waiting period for prospective gun buyers. Like other states, it does set forth certain prohibitions on gun possession.

For years, South Carolina has required those wanting to carry a concealed firearm to obtain a concealed weapons permit (CWP) in most circumstances. Exceptions included carrying a firearm on your property, at your place of business, or for hunting.

In 2024, the state legislature is considering bills to abandon this requirement. If South Carolina enacts a permitless carry law, individuals could carry a concealed handgun without first getting a permit and passing a criminal background check.

States with permitless carry laws, sometimes called constitutional carry laws, operate on the honor system. They presume that citizens know when the law prohibits them from having a gun and will only carry one legally. Once a state moves to permitless carry, it keeps its state permit process so that permit-holders can benefit from reciprocity in other states.

South Carolina residents or non-residents who own property in South Carolina can apply for a CWP. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) handles both first-time and renewal applications.

South Carolina is a “shall issue” state, which means that it must issue a CWP to anyone who meets the objective criteria in state law. At present, that includes being at least 21 years old, providing proof of firearms safety training, and not falling into a prohibited category. Even those with a CWP must comply with state law that prohibits firearms in certain locations.

In South Carolina, you cannot bring a gun into the following places:

  * Law enforcement, correctional, or detention facility
  * Courthouse or courtroom
  * Polling place on election days
  * Office of or the business meeting of the governing body of a county, public school district, municipality, or special purpose district
  * School or college athletic events not related to firearms
  * Daycare or preschool facility
  * Places where carrying of firearms is prohibited under federal law
  * Church or other established religious sanctuary unless given express permission from the appropriate official(s)
  * Hospital, medical clinic, doctor’s office, or other facility where medical services or procedures occur unless authorized by employer
  * Places marked with clear signage prohibiting the carrying of a concealable weapon on the premises, except when given express written consent by the property owner or their agent



South Carolina prohibits firearms in public or private schools, colleges, universities, and publicly-owned buildings unless you have the express permission of the authorized persons in charge.

South Carolina also regulates the carrying of guns in a motor vehicle. Passengers cannot carry a firearm onto a bus or other form of public transportation. You cannot carry a handgun in a motor vehicle unless you have a CWP or you meet one of several exceptions. Some of the exceptions include:

  * Being a licensed hunter or fisherman
  * Transporting an unloaded handgun in a secure wrapper after purchase
  * Moving it to a new residence or place of business



You may also secure a handgun in a vehicle in a closed glove compartment, closed console, closed trunk, or closed container in the luggage compartment of the vehicle.

### Illegal Arms

In South Carolina, unless you comply with federal law, you cannot possess the following firearms under state law:

  * Machine guns
  * Sawed-off shotguns
  * Sawed-off rifles
  * Military firearms



State law also prohibits possession of the following:

  * Teflon-coated ammunition
  * Handguns with the original serial number removed or obliterated

There are other categories of prohibited persons under federal law.

### License Required?

No. A license is not required to own a gun in South Carolina.

### Concealed Carry License Required?

Yes. At present, South Carolina requires individuals to have a concealed weapon permit (CWP) to carry a concealed weapon. There are exceptions to the permit requirement, including licensed hunters while engaged in hunting and law enforcement officers.

### Open Carry Allowed?

Yes. At present, only those with a CWP can also open carry a handgun.

Mississippi’s gun laws have evolved significantly over the past decade, reflecting the state’s dedication to responsible firearm ownership and community safety. From concealed carry regulations to discussions on “red flag” laws and the strengthening of self-defense rights, these changes underscore Mississippi’s proactive approach to firearm regulation. As the state continues to shape its laws, it remains vital for stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens to engage in informed discussions that balance individual rights with the security of the community.

### Firearm Laws in Mississippi

### General Overview

Mississippi’s gun laws are lenient, often resulting in high rates of firearm-related crimes. With 12 murders by firearms per 100,000 residents, Mississippi ranks third highest in the nation for this statistic. According to the Brady scorecard, which ranks states’ gun control laws, Mississippi scored a mere 6 out of 100.

### Regulations for Firearms

In Mississippi, no permit is required to purchase handguns or long guns, and neither registration nor licensing is mandated for these firearms. However, carrying a handgun involves more regulations. A permit is not required to carry a rifle, but it can be disallowed in specified areas such as schools, places of worship, or government buildings.

### Restrictions on Possession

Restrictions on firearm possession apply mainly to former convicts. Unless pardoned, a convicted felon cannot lawfully carry a gun. However, a former convict can possess a gun if granted a rehabilitation certificate by the court where they were sentenced. If rehabilitation can be proved following jail time, gun possession rights may be restored.

### Concealed Carry Regulations

Carrying a concealed pistol in Mississippi involves specific regulations. It is legal for anyone over 18 to carry a concealed firearm in their home or place of business and during sporting events that require a firearm. In other instances, a license is required. The application process for a concealed carry permit includes a 120-day waiting period, and applicants must be at least 21 years old, live in Mississippi for a minimum of 12 months, possess a clean criminal background, and show no signs of mental instability. Applicants must submit fingerprints, a full-face photograph, and a fee of approximately $100. If granted, the license is valid for four years and does not authorize carrying a gun in schools, places of worship, athletic events, parades, or public parks.

### Balancing Gun Control and Gun Rights

As the national debate regarding gun control and the rights of gun owners shows no signs of cooling down, states must strike their own balance in their gun laws and regulations. State legislators often seek to respond to incidences of gun violence but must assess what role the law can play to improve gun safety.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal and State Regulation

The Second Amendment permits individuals to keep and bear arms, but states can outlaw certain weapons and accessories. They can also establish licenses and permits for the purchase of firearms and the carrying of concealed firearms in public.

The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 (as amended) sets forth a baseline of federal laws related to interstate commerce in firearms. It includes a licensing and regulation scheme for those who manufacture, produce, and sell guns. Federal law prohibits the possession or ownership of firearms by persons with felony convictions, misdemeanor domestic violence convictions, mental illness impairments, or substance abuse issues. Federal firearms dealers must also conduct a background check on all gun purchases through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### Iowa Gun Laws

### Permitless Carry and Optional Permits (2021)

In 2021, Iowa enacted new laws that included a “permitless carry” law and made the permit application to acquire a firearm optional. Gun sales between private individuals no longer require a background check. The permitless carry law allows law-abiding individuals to carry a loaded firearm on their person, either openly or concealed, in public.

### Restricted Locations for Firearms

Iowa law prohibits the presence of firearms in certain public places:

  * Within 1,000 feet of a public or private elementary or secondary school or park (weapons-free zones)
  * School buses
  * Casinos



Federal law also restricts firearms in these locations:

  * Post offices and their parking lots
  * Federal facilities
  * IRS offices
  * Federal courthouses
  * Airports (secure areas)
  * Ranger stations
  * Federal buildings in federal parks



The status of gun bans in sensitive areas has become volatile since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022). This ruling affirmed the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to carry arms for self-defense in public. The Court held that regulations burdening the right to bear arms must be reviewed case by case, and the government must show that the regulation in question aligns with traditional, historical firearms regulation in the U.S.

### State Constitutional Amendment (2022)

In 2022, Iowans passed a state constitutional amendment stating:

“The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The sovereign state of Iowa affirms and recognizes this right to be a fundamental individual right. Any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.”

### Permitting Process

The Iowa Department of Public Safety oversees a permitting process to aid in reciprocity with other states. An individual may complete a permit application available at the sheriff’s office of their county of residence. Iowa permits include:

  * Permit to acquire a pistol or revolver
  * Nonprofessional carry weapons permit
  * Professional carry weapons permit



### Age Requirements

Iowans can purchase long guns (rifles and shotguns) once they are 18 years old. To purchase or possess a handgun (pistol or revolver) or get a carry weapons permit, a resident must be 21 years old. Certain exceptions apply for persons 18–20 who are on duty as a peace officer, security guard, correctional officer, or member of the military.

### Training Requirements

Nonprofessional carry permit applicants must show they have met state-issued training requirements, which may include completion of a training course through the National Rifle Association (NRA) or other organizations approved by the Department of Public Safety. Professional carry permits are issued to law enforcement officers, private investigators, or security guards, justifying the need to be armed.

### No Waiting Period

Iowa imposes no waiting period for gun purchases. Buyers must be of legal age and not fall under legal prohibitions for possession, such as having a felony conviction.

### Prohibited Firearms

Iowa does not ban assault weapons, but some firearms are illegal, including:

  * Machine guns (with limited exceptions for law enforcement and the military)
  * Short-barreled shotguns
  * Short-barreled rifles
  * Suppressors (silencers) if not compliant with federal law



### Prohibited Ownership

Individuals cannot own firearms if they:

  * Have a felony conviction
  * Are adjudicated delinquent for a crime that would be a felony if committed by an adult
  * Are under 21 years old (with exceptions)
  * Have a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction or are subject to a domestic violence protective order

### Concealed Carry and Open Carry

A concealed carry license is not required if a person is not otherwise disqualified under state or federal law. Open carry is allowed, except for pistols or revolvers in the state capitol building and grounds or other prohibited locations.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

To obtain a nonprofessional permit to carry weapons, applicants must:

  * Be 21 years of age or older
  * Complete and sign an application form and display a proper identification card, such as a driver’s license
  * Show no probable cause that they will use the weapon unlawfully
  * Not be addicted to alcohol
  * Have no felony conviction
  * Have not been convicted of any aggravated misdemeanor or serious misdemeanor under Chapter 708 (Assault) in the last three years
  * Complete approved firearm safety training
  * Not be otherwise prohibited from owning a firearm under Iowa or federal laws



### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

Unauthorized possession of offensive weapons, suppressors, short-barreled shotguns, or short-barreled rifles is a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $10,245. Possession of a firearm by a person with a felony or a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction, or while under a domestic violence protective order, is also a Class D felony. Possession of a loaded firearm by a minor is a serious misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $2,560. Making a false statement on an application for a permit to carry weapons is a Class D felony.

### Penalties for Illegal Possession on or Near School Grounds

Carrying a firearm on or near school grounds is a Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $10,245.

### Alabama Gun Laws: A Comprehensive Overview

The state of Alabama has one of the largest populations of gun owners in the United States, and its gun laws have been under scrutiny for many years. In the past decade, Alabama’s gun laws have experienced significant changes, impacting gun owners, sellers, and users. This article will examine these changes and explore their implications on gun laws and regulation changes in Alabama.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Historical Perspective

Before delving into the recent changes in Alabama gun laws, it’s essential to take a look at the state’s historical perspective. Alabama, like many other states in the US, has a long-standing tradition of gun ownership and firearm-related activities. The Second Amendment of the US Constitution grants its citizens the right to bear arms, and until recently, Alabama’s laws have been lenient regarding firearms.

Historically, the state’s gun laws did not require registration or licensing of firearms, and many other provisions were loosely enforced. In recent years, however, the state has rolled out changes to its gun laws, some of which have been controversial.

### Changes to Alabama’s Gun Laws

### Permitless Carry Law

One of the most significant changes to Alabama’s gun laws is the enactment of a permitless carry law, which allows people to carry guns concealed without a permit. The law, signed in May 2021, is viewed by gun rights activists as a huge success. However, law enforcement agents have raised concerns about how the law could impact public safety.

Under the permitless carry law, anyone over the age of 21 can carry a handgun concealed without a permit or undergoing any training. It is not a requirement to register a handgun, making it easier for anyone to acquire a gun, regardless of their ability or gun handling skills. The law also allows people to carry guns in their cars without a license, which could come in handy during road trips.

Opponents of the law fear it will lead to more gun-related deaths, given that people who are untrained will be carrying handguns without restrictions. Those who support the permitless carry law assert that it empowers citizens, who should not require permits to exercise their constitutional rights.

### Stricter Gun Dealer Laws

Apart from permitless carry laws, Alabama has also toughened its gun dealer laws to regulate dealer activities. Dealers are now required to keep records of gun sales and undergo extensive background checks to ensure they are qualified and reliable.

Previously, dealers faced minimal regulations, and there were cases of dealers being involved in illegal gun sales. The stricter gun dealer laws have gone a long way in restoring public trust and reducing gun-related crimes.

### The Red Flag Law

In 2019, Alabama enacted the Red Flag Law, permitting family members or law enforcement officers to request the temporary removal of firearms owned by someone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. The law allows courts to order firearms removed temporarily, providing time for a person in crisis to receive treatment without access to firearms.

In most cases, people who commit crimes with guns have a history of mental illness or suicidal tendencies. By enacting the Red Flag Law, Alabama has taken a significant step in ensuring that guns aren’t used to harm oneself or others.

### Enhanced Concealed Carry Permits

Alabama has enhanced its concealed carry permit process, requiring firearms training, a more rigorous background check, and mental health evaluations. The aim of these enhancements is to ensure that only the most qualified individuals who meet gun-carrying requirements receive permits.

Alabama is also one of the five states that have enacted legislation allowing the carrying of firearms in public places like state parks. Non-residents are also permitted to carry firearms in Alabama, provided they adhere to the state’s guidelines.

### Impact on State-Based Gambling

Gambling has been a significant part of Alabama life, and the state has added a unique component to gambling-related gun laws. Casinos, gambling operations, and related institutions must operate under stringent regulations. It is critical that any guns found within these facilities are appropriately stored and regulated.

### Conclusion

Alabama’s gun laws have undergone significant changes in recent years aimed at promoting gun safety and regulation. The state’s move to permitless carry laws, stricter gun dealer laws, enactment of the Red Flag Law, enhanced concealed carry permits, and enhanced gun storage rules in gambling establishments have gone a long way in closing the gap in past firearm regulations and preventing gun-related crimes.

The new laws have stirred mixed reactions, with gun enthusiasts and rights advocates supporting them, and many law enforcement agencies opposing them. Going forward, it’s essential that the changing landscape of gun laws is monitored closely, priorities are kept clear, and safety is ensured. By keeping abreast of these changes, Alabama can remain at the forefront of responsible gun ownership.

### Gun Control Laws in Oregon: Overview

State gun laws are usually more comprehensive than federal law. Still, state laws that regulate the purchase and use of guns vary quite a bit from state to state, often reflecting regional traditions and attitudes toward guns. Some states require a permit for buying a gun or include a waiting period for a background check. Other states have very few restrictions.

Oregon does not ban assault weapons. The open carry of firearms is legal, but some restrictions are in sensitive locations and safety concerns in larger cities. The state requires a concealed carry permit for handguns.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

In 2022, Oregon voters narrowly passed Measure 114, a gun safety law. This ballot measure included a ban on high-capacity magazines and the creation of a firearm purchase permit. The new law has faced legal challenges in state and federal courts.

### Oregon Concealed Handgun License

If you want to carry a concealed handgun in the state of Oregon, you need to get a concealed handgun license (CHL). The law has exceptions for those who only conceal a pistol at their homes or places of business.

State law has objective criteria you must meet to get a CHL. This includes passing a criminal background check proving that you are not legally prohibited from having a firearm.

You file your application with your local county sheriff. You must give your fingerprints and two references as part of the application process. The sheriff’s office will photograph you as well. You must be 21 or older to apply. You also must show competence with the handgun — usually by proof you completed a firearms safety course. There are no waiting periods under Oregon law. So, once you meet all the criteria, the state will issue you a license.

CHL holders have limited location restrictions. For example, even with a concealed weapons permit, you can’t take a gun into a courthouse or into the secure area of a correctional facility or a commercial airport.

Oregon has no reciprocity law. So, the sheriff is not likely to recognize a concealed carry license from out of state. If you have concerns or questions about that, get answers before you travel to Oregon with a firearm.

### Ban on Undetectable Firearms

In 2021, state lawmakers passed a law prohibiting so-called “ghost guns,” firearms that a metal detector can’t detect. The law defines an undetectable firearm as one that:

  * Was constructed or produced entirely of nonmetal substances (including by 3D printing)
  * Is not detectable by a walk-through metal detector after removal of grips, stocks, and magazines
  * Includes a major component that does not generate an accurate image in X-ray devices commonly used at airports



The law also bans firearms without a serial number and unfinished frames and receivers.

### Overview of Oregon Gun Control Laws

### Illegal Arms

Oregon law bans the following:

  * Machine guns*
  * Short-barreled rifles*
  * Short-barreled shotguns*
  * Firearms silencers*
  * Large capacity magazines**
  * Undetectable firearms

*unless registered and lawful under federal law

### Open Carry Allowed?

It depends. In general, open carry of firearms is allowed in Oregon. But local jurisdictions can ban the carry of firearms in public places by persons who do not hold a CHL or who are not otherwise authorized (like police officers). For example, see Multnomah County Ordinance 15.064.

### Gun Control in New Mexico

Increases in gun violence in American cities and the prevalence of mass shootings throughout the nation continue to raise questions about gun control laws in America. In 2023, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham took the unusual step of declaring a public health emergency in the state due to gun violence.

The emergency order came after three child-related gun fatalities occurred in a matter of weeks. The Governor’s administration issued public health orders that temporarily suspended open and concealed carry of firearms in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. Gun rights proponents challenged her orders in court. The Governor later amended her orders.

States face a difficult challenge as they try to balance the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the needs of public safety. Finding consensus on gun regulations is difficult in political times where issues can become polarized overnight.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Gun Laws

A discussion of gun laws begins with federal law. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens to bear arms for lawful purposes such as self-defense.

In recent decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized that the right to own and carry guns in public is an individual right. It requires courts to view any laws that burden the right to bear arms through a historical test. First, the court examines whether the conduct falls under the plain text of the amendment’s protections. Next, the court must determine if the government can show that the regulation aligns with the historical regulation of firearms.

Federal firearms law comes from Congress’ role in regulating interstate commerce. As a result, it set up a framework for taxing and issuing licenses for the legal manufacture, sale, possession, and use of certain dangerous firearms.

Federal firearms dealers must run a criminal background check on anyone purchasing a firearm from their business. Federal law created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to assist law enforcement in keeping guns from those who are banned under the law. This includes convicted felons, those addicted to and using illegal drugs, and others.

### Gun Control Laws in New Mexico

New Mexico residents must comply with federal firearms law as well as state firearms laws. State gun control laws restrict the sale, ownership, and use of firearms, and vary from state to state.

While it’s true that the Second Amendment protects the right to own guns, states can pass their own regulations. State laws may restrict who can purchase and possess guns, the carrying of firearms, and, in some cases, what kinds of weapons and accessories are legal to own.

New Mexico gun laws fall in the middle of the pack. The state has certain laws praised by gun control advocates, including a requirement that private gun sales must go through a licensed dealer for a criminal background check. Residents must also obtain a concealed carry permit to carry a concealed handgun on foot.

New Mexico also supports the rights of gun owners. The state does not ban assault weapons and there is no state-imposed waiting period to purchase a gun.

### New Mexico Gun Statutes

Gun laws in New Mexico include licensing provisions related to the concealed carry of handguns and prohibitions on the possession and carrying of firearms. In 2020, the state also enacted a red flag law allowing law enforcement to seek court orders against persons who become a threat to themselves or others with access to a gun.

As a Western state, the open carry of loaded or unloaded firearms in public is legal. New Mexico law regulates the concealed carry of a loaded handgun. The law requires citizens to have a state-issued license to carry a concealed loaded handgun in public. In the view of the state, in public means away from your own home, real property, or motor vehicle.

New Mexico residents apply for a license through the Department of Public Safety (DPS). This can occur through a local law enforcement agency. They must submit two sets of fingerprints and a certified copy of a certificate of completion from a DPS-approved firearms safety course of at least 15 hours in duration.

New Mexico is a “shall issue” state. If applicants meet all objective eligibility criteria and pass a criminal background check, they will be issued a concealed handgun license. Permit holders with questions about reciprocity in neighboring states can check the DPS website for updated information.

As in other states, carry laws remain subject to location restrictions. State and federal law may limit where an otherwise law-abiding citizen can take a firearm. In New Mexico, prohibited locations for firearms include:

  * Public schools and their premises
  * Buses
  * Licensed liquor establishments
  * University premises
  * Adult correctional facilities, prisons, and jails
  * Juvenile correctional facilities
  * Preschools
  * Private property when notice is provided
  * Courts
  * Tribal land unless authorized by the governing body



Most of these restricted areas come with exceptions for law enforcement officers. There may be other exceptions based on authorization provided by the owner or controller of the property.

### Summary of Montana Gun Laws

Montana is a shall-issue, permitless carry state, with concealed weapons permits processed locally by the county sheriff’s office.

No permit is required to purchase a firearm from a private individual, and there is no waiting period or firearms registration in the state. Background checks are not necessary for private sales but are required when purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer, except for Montana Concealed Weapons Permit holders.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Montana without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. The federal minimum age is 18, but state law allows 14-year-olds to carry or use a firearm in public under direct supervision of a parent, guardian, qualified firearms safety instructor, or an authorized adult. Some areas, such as federal buildings, are off-limits. Concealed carry is defined as carrying a handgun that is wholly or partially covered by clothing or apparel.

### Concealed Carry

Concealed carry is legal without a permit for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally own a firearm in most locations. A permit is required to carry concealed in portions of buildings used for state or local government offices and related restricted areas. HB-102, effective February 18, 2021, eliminated many prior gun-free zones in the state. Local municipalities can prohibit unpermitted concealed carry in publicly owned and occupied buildings. Montana does not issue permits to non-residents. Montana recognizes permits from states that require criminal records background checks.

### Use of Force in Defense of Occupied Structure

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another when they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate unlawful entry into or attack upon an occupied structure. Deadly force is justified only if:

  * The entry is made or attempted, and the person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent an assault upon themselves or another in the occupied structure; or
  * The person reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony in the occupied structure.



### Use of Force in Defense of Person

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another when they reasonably believe it is necessary for self-defense or the defense of another against the other person’s imminent use of unlawful force. Deadly force is justified only if the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

### Self-Defense

Montana follows the Castle Doctrine and has a “stand your ground” law. A person who is lawfully in a place and threatened with bodily injury or loss of life has no duty to retreat or to summon law enforcement assistance before using force.

### Use of Force in Defense of Other Property

A person is justified in using force or threatening to use force against another to prevent or terminate trespass on or criminal interference with real property (other than an occupied structure) or personal property lawfully in their possession or in the possession of an immediate family or household member, or a person whose property they have a legal duty to protect. Deadly force is justified only if the person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

“Forcible felony” refers to any felony involving the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.

### Summary of Wyoming Gun Laws

Wyoming operates as a shall-issue state for concealed firearms permits (CFP). Applications are handled locally by county sheriffs and issued by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI). Local law enforcement exercises discretion in permit issuance.

### Firearm Purchase and Carry Laws

In Wyoming, no permit is required for purchasing firearms from private individuals, and there are no background checks or waiting periods. Firearms registration is not mandatory, except when buying handguns from Federal Firearms Dealers. Possession of a Wyoming CFP exempts holders from federal background check requirements.

Open carry is legal without a permit for individuals aged 18 and above who are legally entitled to possess firearms.

A Wyoming CFP necessitates completion of a state-approved firearms training course or documented firearm experience (e.g., organized shooting competitions or military service). Wyoming does not issue non-resident permits but honors permits from states recognizing Wyoming permits.

### Self-Defense Laws

Wyoming adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and “stand your ground” laws, eliminating the duty to retreat. Individuals may use reasonable defensive force, including deadly force if necessary, to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm. There is a presumption of reasonable fear when defending against intruders unlawfully entering homes or attempting forceful removal.

### Criminal Immunity

Individuals employing legal and reasonable defensive force are protected from criminal prosecution for such actions in Wyoming.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Handgun Purchase and Possession

To purchase a handgun from a private individual in Hawaii, a permit to purchase, background check, and firearms registration are required. There is a mandatory 14-day waiting period for purchase permits. All firearms and ammunition must be registered with the county’s Chief of Police where the possessor resides, works, or is temporarily staying.

### Non-Resident Firearm Possession

Non-residents can transport firearms into Hawaii if they possess a hunting license, shooting preserve permit, invitation to shoot on private land, or written notification from a firing range. Registration at a police station within 72 hours of arrival is mandatory. Each firearm’s make, model, and serial number must be licensed.

### Open and Concealed Carry

Hawaii permits both open and concealed carry of handguns with a Hawaii license to carry, valid only within the county of issue. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and complete a state-approved firearms training course for concealed carry licenses.

### Legal Challenges and Reciprocity

The state and counties of Hawaii have sought rehearing of the Young v. Hawaii court case by the Ninth Circuit due to restrictive handgun permitting policies. Hawaii does not issue non-resident licenses nor recognize CCW licenses from other states.

### Use of Force Laws in Hawaii

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TMCVgNoKp2NAtvLSAMkaJg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Self-Defense

Hawaii follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves inside their home or place of business without a duty to retreat. Outside these locations, retreat is required if it can be done safely.

### Protection of Others

Force can be used to protect others if the actor believes it’s necessary and the person being protected would also be justified in using protective force. Similar to self-defense, retreat is required if safe and feasible.

### Protection of Property

Force is justified to prevent unlawful entry or theft of property in the actor’s possession or another’s possession they’re protecting. Deadly force can only be used to prevent serious crimes involving threats of deadly force.

These laws outline the rights and responsibilities of gun owners and individuals using force for protection under Hawaii state statutes.

> Legal information provided is for reference and not legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific legal concerns.

### Summary of South Carolina Gun Laws

South Carolina operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state, where concealed weapons permits (CWPs) are issued by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).

### Handgun Purchase Regulations

There is no requirement for a permit, background check, or firearms registration when purchasing a handgun from a private individual.

### Open and Concealed Carry Laws

As of March 7th, 2024, open carry and concealed carry without a permit are legal for individuals aged 18 or older, provided they are not prohibited by law. A “concealable weapon” can be openly carried or concealed on one’s person, except in areas where concealed carry is prohibited, such as private properties posted with ‘No Concealable Weapons Allowed’ signs.

### Concealed Weapons Permits (CWPs)

CWPs are issued to residents, non-residents who own property in South Carolina, and military personnel stationed in the state. Applicants must complete an 8-hour state-approved firearms training course. The minimum age requirement for a CWP is now 18 years old.

### Reciprocity

South Carolina recognizes resident permits from states that also recognize South Carolina permits, provided the reciprocal state requires a criminal background check and firearms training course for issuance.

### Off-Limits Areas

Certain locations are off-limits for concealed carry, including schools and courthouses.

### Self-Defense Laws

South Carolina follows the Castle Doctrine. Individuals attacked in a place where they have a right to be do not have a duty to retreat and may stand their ground. Deadly force is justified if there is a reasonable fear of imminent death, great bodily harm, or the commission of a violent crime against themselves or others in certain situations, including unlawful and forcible entries into dwellings, residences, or occupied vehicles.

  * **Dwelling:** A building or conveyance designed for people to lodge at night.

A governing body putting a restriction on open carry needs to give a specific area, duration, and manner for the restriction and provide prior notice of the restriction.

Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Louisiana Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) and for non-residents with a permit/license from a state recognized by Louisiana. As of August 1st, 2022, constitutional carry is legal for resident active duty military and veterans only.

Applicants must be at least 21 years old, a resident of Louisiana, and complete a firearms training course. There are exemptions for non-residents who are in the military and have a Louisiana driver’s license or Louisiana state ID.

### Use of Force in Defense

The use of force is justifiable under either of the following circumstances:

  * When committed for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the person or a forcible offense or trespass against property in a person’s lawful possession, provided that the force or violence used must be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent such offense.
  * When committed by a person against an unlawful entry into the dwelling, place of business, or motor vehicle, and the person using the force or violence reasonably believes that the use of force or violence is necessary to prevent the entry or to compel the intruder to leave the dwelling, place of business, or motor vehicle.



### Self-Defense

Louisiana is a Castle Doctrine state with a “stand your ground” statute. There is no duty to retreat in any place a person has the legal right to be before using force or violence, and a person may meet force with force.

30 days for a resident of 5 or more years and 60 days for nonresidents or residents of less than 5 years.

**Non-Resident Concealed Carry Permits:**

Non-residents use the same process as residents. Link to nonresident application

**Name/Address Changes:** You must make notification of changes of address within 30 days of moving. If you wait more than 30 days, your permit becomes invalid and you must start over as a new applicant at full cost. If you currently hold a valid permit issued through the Maine State Police (MSP):

  * If you move to another address in the same town, you can call the MSP and update your address over the phone; you do not need to send any money and you will not receive a new permit; if you want a new permit reflecting your new address in the same town, send in page one of the application, filled out completely, and include a check/money order for $2.00 payable to Treasurer, State of Maine.
  * If you move to another town in which the MSP is still the Issuing Authority, you must fill out page one of the resident application or non-resident application completely and send it in with a check/money order for $2.00.
  * If your current valid permit has been issued from an Issuing Authority other than the MSP — a police department or the town’s selectmen — and you move to a town in which the Maine State Police is the Issuing Authority, you must fill out the complete resident application packet, even the authority to release information pages at the back of the packet, and send it to the MSP with a check/money order for $2.00. Note: The MSP requires a photo, a copy of your birth certificate, a copy of your current concealed carry permit and a copy of a handgun safety certificate. Normally the handgun safety certificate must be less than 5 years old, but in this instance only, it does not have to be; it can be more than 5 years old. Name changes can be made using the same resident application or non-resident application form.



**Lost/Stolen Permits:**

Contact your local State Police Office.

**Residency Changes:**

Moving to Maine and interested in applying for a resident permit? How soon can you apply? Maine issues resident and non-resident permits, so you can apply for your permit at any time. You may apply as a resident once you have a voter’s registration card, a Maine driver’s license or state ID. Moving from Maine and have a Maine resident permit? Does that permit transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your Maine permit remains valid? If a person with a Maine permit to carry concealed handguns establishes residency in another state, the permit is valid provided you follow the procedures in the above referenced Name/Address changes section.

### Summary of Florida Gun Laws

**Permitless Carry and Licensing** Florida is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Concealed weapons licenses are issued at the state level by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).

No license, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual. Buyers must be at least 21 years old to purchase any firearm. Some counties have waiting periods for purchases from non-licensed sellers, but Florida Concealed Weapons License (CWL) holders are exempt.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

**Open Carry Restrictions** Open carry is not legal in Florida, except for limited exceptions such as fishing, camping, lawful hunting, or target practice at an indoor range.

**Concealed Carry Regulations** Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Florida CWL and for non-residents with a CCW permit from a state that Florida honors. Permitless concealed carry is legal for anyone 21 years old or older who is not prohibited by law from carrying a firearm. The Florida CWL allows holders to carry not only a handgun but also other weapons such as electronic weapons, tear gas guns, billie clubs, and knives. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and have completed a firearms training course, or be a current member of the military or an honorably discharged veteran. CWLs are issued to residents and non-residents. Florida only honors resident CCW licenses from states with which it has a reciprocity agreement.

**New Legislation** On April 3, 2023, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 543 into law, making Florida the 26th constitutional carry state in the U.S. This law took effect on July 1, 2023.

### Use of Force

**Non-Deadly Force** A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except deadly force, if they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or another against imminent unlawful force. There is no duty to retreat before using or threatening to use such force.

**Deadly Force** A person is justified in using deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent commission of a forcible felony or imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another. There is no duty to retreat and individuals have the right to stand their ground, provided they are not engaged in criminal activity and are in a place where they have a right to be.

Deadly force is also justified when resisting an attempt to murder or commit any felony upon oneself or in any dwelling where the person is located. The law presumes a reasonable fear of imminent death or bodily harm if an alleged perpetrator unlawfully enters or remains or attempts to remove another person against their will. Anyone who unlawfully and by force enters or attempts to enter another’s home or vehicle is presumed to have intent to commit an unlawful act involving force or violence.

### Self-Defense

Florida follows the Castle Doctrine. There is no duty to retreat if you are attacked in any place you have a lawful right to be. You may stand your ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if you reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to yourself or others.

In addition, a local official who knowingly and willfully violates the statute shall be fined up to $5,000; may not be indemnified for the costs of defending himself or herself; and may be removed from office by the governor. Per the passage of SB 1884, as of July 1, 2021, a person can maintain a legal action against a preempted local regulation applies even if the local regulation is unwritten.

### Summary of North Dakota Gun Laws

### NORTH DAKOTA CONCEALED CARRY LAWS

North Dakota operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry licenses, where the attorney general oversees issuance, with some discretion for law enforcement to deny based on perceived risks.

Permits, firearms registration, or background checks aren’t required for purchasing handguns privately.

Open carry of handguns is legal for residents with a Concealed Weapon License (CWL) and non-residents with a valid resident concealed carry license from a recognized state. Minimum age for carry is 18, with some areas such as bars off-limits.

### CONCEALED CARRY DEFINITION

In North Dakota, concealed carry is defined as carrying a weapon in a manner not discernible by ordinary observation. Permitless concealed carry is allowed for both residents and non-residents as of August 1st, 2023. Individuals must carry a driver’s license or state ID and inform law enforcement of firearm possession during any in-person contact.

### CLASSES OF CWLS

North Dakota issues Class 1 and Class 2 CWLs. Class 1 permits have broader reciprocity due to additional testing requirements. Both licenses require completion of a state-certified firearms training course.

### RECIPROCITY ISSUES

There’s ongoing clarification regarding permit reciprocity. As of August 1, 2021, North Dakota recognizes permits from states it honors. However, nuances exist regarding non-resident permits, with ongoing updates influencing reciprocity.

### USE OF FORCE LAWS

North Dakota allows force to prevent unlawful entry, property damage, or theft. Individuals using force justifiably are immune from civil liability for injuries or deaths caused to intruders.

### SELF-DEFENSE LAWS

Under North Dakota law, individuals may use force against imminent bodily harm, sexual assault, or unlawful detention. The state supports a Stand Your Ground law, effective August 1, 2021, removing the duty to retreat in places one legally occupies.

### DEADLY FORCE

Deadly force is justified to prevent death, serious injury, or violent felonies against oneself or others. Individuals must avoid using excessive force and attempt retreat unless safety is jeopardized.

North Dakota upholds laws that protect individuals’ rights to self-defense and secure living environments.

There is currently some confusion about ND reciprocity. The ND Attorney General’s website indicates that in accordance with N.D.C.C. § 62.1–04–03.1, North Dakota will honor a valid concealed carry license/permit (resident and non-resident) issued by a state that has agreed to recognize a North Dakota license. However, HB 1293 (which took effect on August 1, 2021) included the following language, “an individual may carry a firearm concealed under this chapter if the individual qualifies for reciprocity under section 62.1–04–03.1 and the individual has the equivalent of a class 2 firearm and dangerous weapon license from the state in which the individual is a resident.”

Therefore, the USCCA map shows the more conservative version until this issue is resolved.

### Residency Changes:

Moving to North Dakota and interested in applying for a resident license? How soon can you apply?  
North Dakota issues licenses to residents, full-time active military duty stationed in the state and to concealed carry permit holders of states which have reciprocity with North Dakota. You can apply for your license at any time. In order to apply for a resident license, you may need to provide a North Dakota driver’s license or state ID.

Moving from North Dakota and have a North Dakota resident license? Does that license transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your North Dakota license remains valid?  
If a person with a North Dakota concealed weapon license establishes residency in another state, the license is valid until it expires provided the individual notifies the BCI of a change of address.

### Fees:

Initial licenses and renewals: $60

### Valid For:

5 years

### Processing Time:

60 days

### Application:

Online Concealed Weapons Application  
Concealed Weapons License Manual  
Link to application

### Class 1/Class 2 Licenses

**Class 1/Class 2 Licenses**  
The only difference between a Class 1 license and a Class 2 license is reciprocity. Both licenses are equally valid within North Dakota, but because of additional testing requirements, the holders of a Class 1 license have reciprocity in many more states than those who hold a Class 2 license.

**Note:** An individual who has a valid Class 2 license may apply to upgrade to a Class 1 license within 5 years from the date the Class 2 license was issued, by completing the additional testing requirements of a Class 1 license and submitting an application form along with the $60 application fee and required documents.

### Non-Resident Concealed Carry licenses:

North Dakota issues licenses to full-time active military duty stationed in ND and residents of states which have reciprocity with North Dakota, provided the individual possesses a valid concealed carry permit from that state. However, all testing must take place within the state of ND and cannot be held in conjunction with testing for any other state. The application must be submitted to the BCI within 30 days of the testing date.

### Name/Address Changes:

By law, you must notify the BCI of a change of address. Mail a letter with your full legal name, date of birth, old address and new address, and the effective date of the new address to:  
**BCI CWL — ADDRESS CHANGE  
PO Box 1054  
Bismarck, ND 58502**

For security reasons, the BCI can only accept a change of address notification received by mail.

If you would like a replacement license with your new address, you must send in the old license with your address change letter. If you do not send in the old license, the BCI will not issue an updated license. You are not required to get an updated license — your license is still valid even if it has your old address. If you send in your license to have it updated, you cannot carry concealed until you receive the updated license. Please allow 2–3 weeks for the updated license to be issued.

### Lost/Stolen licenses:

You may request a free replacement from the BCI. Simply send a written request to the BCI and include your full name, current address, date of birth and the reason you need a replacement license.

### North Dakota Concealed Carry License Application Process

### Step 1:

All new applicants must complete the required training before submitting an application. Contact a test administrator to schedule your training and testing. Check with the test administrator before completing the application — many test administrators provide a computer and printer at the training site for this purpose.

### Step 2:

Decide if you want a Class 1 or Class 2 license.

  * Complete the ONLINE APPLICATION You will need a printer. The last step of the online application process generates a form that you are required to print; OR
  * Download the application, complete it and print out a copy to mail in; OR
  * Complete it at the testing site, if available.



### Step 3:

Make an appointment with a test administrator and take a copy of the printed application to the testing appointment. The test administrator may charge up to $50 (plus range fees, if applicable). All first-time applicants must pass a written, open-book test based on the Concealed Weapon License Manual.

All testing must take place within the state of North Dakota and cannot be held in conjunction with testing for any other state. The application must be submitted to the BCI within 30 days of the testing date.

### Step 4:

Applicants for a Class 1 license will also need to complete classroom instruction, demonstrate familiarity with the weapon, and successfully complete a firearms proficiency shooting test.

### Step 5:

Gather the following required documents and submit them to the Bureau of Criminal Inspection (BCI) within 30 days of the testing date (Applications submitted more than 30 days after the testing date are invalid and cannot be processed):

  * Cashiers check or money order for $60 payable to “North Dakota Attorney General”;
  * Photocopy of a driver’s license or state ID;
  * Two official color passport photos; and
  * Two fingerprint cards (for new applicants).



**Non-residents** must include a copy of a valid concealed carry license from your home state of residence. (You are a resident of whichever state issued your driver’s license.) If your state does not have reciprocity with ND, you are not eligible for a ND license.

### North Dakota Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

### Step 1:

Renewals are the responsibility of the licensee. The BCI will send a renewal reminder to the last address we have on file. You may begin the renewal process up to 180 days prior to the license expiration date through the expiration date. A renewal application must be postmarked on or before the license expiration date. Late or incomplete applications cannot be processed. If your license has expired, it is not a valid license and cannot be renewed. You will have to start over as a new applicant. IF YOUR LICENSE HAS EXPIRED, DO NOT CARRY CONCEALED!

### Step 2:

Review the requirements. To renew a Class 1 license, you will need to complete the full testing process, just as you did for your initial license. You can “downgrade” to a class 2 license and avoid having to retest by indicating on the application that you would like a class 2 license. You do not have to retest to renew a class 2 license. To “upgrade” an expiring Class 2 license to a Class 1 license, you must complete the application process for a Class 1 license including the required testing, documents and fees.

### Step 5:

Complete the Online Application or print a blank application to complete and submit to the BCI. Be aware that it takes the BCI longer to process these handwritten applications, which may result in a delay issuing your license. Therefore, the BCI encourages you to complete the Online Application if at all possible.

### Step 6:

You will be notified if your application has been approved.

### Summary of Nevada Gun Laws

### Nevada Firearm Laws

Nevada operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, which are issued at the county level.

### Private Firearm Sales

No permit or firearms registration is required for buying a handgun from a private individual in Nevada. However, since January 2, 2020, all sales must be processed through a licensed federal firearms dealer with a background check, excluding temporary transfers and transfers between immediate family members.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Nevada without a permit for individuals 18 years and older who can legally possess a firearm. It is permitted in most public spaces except certain prohibited areas such as school premises and legislative buildings. Firearms carried openly in vehicles must not be concealed on the person without a concealed firearms permit.

### Concealed Carry Permits

Residents of Nevada and non-residents with recognized licenses/permits may legally carry concealed firearms. Applicants must be 21 years old (18 for military), complete an approved firearm safety course, and demonstrate handgun proficiency. Some areas like school premises and public airports are off-limits for concealed carry.

### Justifiable Homicide and Self-Defense

In Nevada, homicide is justifiable in cases of necessary self-defense or defense of occupied habitation, motor vehicle, or against a person manifestly intending violence. The use of deadly force is permissible under these circumstances provided the defender is not the aggressor, has the right to be present, and is not engaged in criminal activity.

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Nevada upholds the Castle Doctrine and “stand your ground” principles, permitting individuals to use force, including deadly force, without retreating if faced with a threat inside their home or workplace. The force used must be immediately necessary and a reasonable response to the aggressor’s actions.

### Immunity from Civil Liability

Individuals using force likely to cause death or bodily injury against an aggressor are immune from civil liability if such force was justified under Nevada law.

These provisions aim to protect individuals’ rights to self-defense within the boundaries of Nevada’s legal framework.

### Summary of Mississippi Gun Laws

Mississippi operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons permits, managed by the Department of Public Safety. Here’s what you need to know:

### Buying Handguns

No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required for private handgun purchases. However, buying from a Federal Firearms Dealer necessitates a background check.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is lawful in Mississippi for individuals aged 18 and above who can legally possess a firearm. The firearm must be carried visibly in a holster, sheath, or scabbard, except where prohibited, such as schools and bars.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry without a permit is permitted for those legally eligible, provided the handgun is carried in a holster or sheath. The state does not specify a minimum age for permitless concealed carry, although the Department of Public Safety generally requires individuals to be 21 years old.

### Types of Permits

Mississippi issues two types of permits at the state level: the Standard Firearms Permit (SFP) and an enhanced version (E-SFP), which grants carry in additional locations. Applicants must be at least 21 years old (or 18 with military affiliation), Mississippi residents, non-residents with valid out-of-state permits, or active duty military stationed in Mississippi.

### Self-Defense Laws

Mississippi adheres to the castle doctrine and “stand your ground” principles. Individuals not initiating aggression or engaged in unlawful activity have no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, provided they are in a place where they have a lawful right to be.

### Justifiable Homicide

Homicide is justified under Mississippi law in cases including resisting imminent threat of death or felony, or in the defense of oneself or others facing imminent danger of felony or significant personal injury. The law extends civil immunity to those acquitted of criminal charges related to justifiable self-defense.

For detailed legal advice tailored to your situation, consult with a qualified attorney.

### Minnesota Concealed Carry Gun Permit Laws

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bxOxCAnwVHehkkqhxMNHIQ.png)

> Legal information provided is for reference and not legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific legal concerns.

### Summary of Minnesota Gun Laws

Minnesota operates under a shall-issue policy for handgun permits, where a sheriff may only deny a permit if there is a substantial likelihood of danger to oneself or others. Permits are issued by the Sheriff’s office in the applicant’s county of residence.

Private handgun sales in Minnesota do not require a permit, background check, or firearm registration.

### Concealed and Open Carry

Both concealed and open carry are legal with a Minnesota Permit to Carry a Pistol (PCP) or a permit from a state that Minnesota honors. There is no stipulation requiring the handgun to be concealed.

### Recent Legal Development

On March 31, 2023, a federal judge ruled unconstitutional a Minnesota law that previously required individuals to be at least 21 years old to obtain a permit to carry a handgun in public. Resident and non-resident permits are available, and non-residents may apply at any sheriff’s office.

### Transporting and Reciprocity

No permit is required for transporting a firearm, keeping it at home, or having it in a place of business. Minnesota honors permits from states with similar requirements in terms of reciprocity.

### Justifiable Taking of Life

Under Minnesota law, the intentional taking of another person’s life is legal only when necessary to prevent great bodily harm, death, or the commission of a felony.

### Self-Defense

Minnesota imposes a duty to retreat, meaning deadly force is justified only as a last resort when a person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent great bodily harm, death, or the commission of a felony. While Minnesota does not have a Castle Doctrine law, it recognizes similar principles.

### Authorized Use of Force

Reasonable force is permissible under Minnesota law in various circumstances, including resisting an offense against oneself or others, defending property from trespass or interference, and in lawful authority roles such as parents, teachers, or school employees ensuring safety.

[Minn. Stat. §§ 609.06 & 609.065]

To buy or transfer ownership of a firearm in Minnesota, you must have a Minnesota Permit to Carry a Pistol or a Permit to Purchase/Transfer a Firearm. The application for a Permit to Purchase/Transfer a Firearm must be submitted in person to your local police chief or county sheriff’s office.

Upon clearing the background check, you will be issued a Permit to Purchase/Transfer a Firearm through the mail, which will be valid for 1 year from the date it is issued. For single-purchase transactions, many gun shops in the state will allow you to apply for a permit to purchase directly at the store. You will still be required to pass a background check before making a purchase. A gun shop may charge for this service. Not every gun shop in the state will process permit applications, per their own discretion.

### Summary of Ohio Gun Laws

Ohio is a shall-issue state, with concealed handgun licenses issued at the county level by a county sheriff.

### Purchasing and Carrying Firearms

No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal without a permit. Individuals 21 years old or older, who are not prohibited from carrying or possessing a handgun, are no longer required to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun as of June 12, 2022. Since open carry is not addressed in state statutes, the federal minimum age for possession of a handgun of 18 years old applies. Note: Carrying in vehicles is not specifically addressed in the Constitutional Carry bill. However, according to the Ohio Attorney General, it is legal to possess a loaded firearm in a vehicle.

### Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

Residents can still obtain a CHL. They must complete eight hours of firearms training and meet other criteria to qualify. Current and former servicemen and women can obtain an Ohio CHL without paying the fee or completing a concealed carry class. Additionally, active duty military personnel with a valid military identification card and documentation of successful firearms training that meets or exceeds Ohio’s requirements do not need to obtain an Ohio license. Non-residents can obtain a CHL if they work in Ohio. In terms of reciprocity, Ohio will honor permits issued by any state or jurisdiction.

### Immunity from Civil Liability

Ohio’s self-defense laws presume that a person has acted in defense of another or self-defense when applying deadly force if that person is in a place they lawfully have a right to be. Therefore, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not use force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of their residence.

Ohio Rev. Code §§ 2901.09, 2901.05

### Self-Defense Laws

Ohio adheres to the Castle Doctrine and, based on the Governor’s signing of SB 175 on January 4, 2021, is now a “stand your ground” state. There is no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of one’s residence, provided the person is in a place they lawfully have a right to be. You must have a genuine belief that you were in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm and that the use of deadly force was the only way to escape the danger. Deadly force may only be used to protect against serious bodily harm or death.

### FAQ: Ohio Concealed Carry Questions

### Can I wear a COVID mask & carry?

**Question:** I can legally carry a concealed firearm in Ohio, but can I wear a COVID-19 protective mask while carrying concealed?

**Answer:** There is no known statute in Ohio making it illegal to wear a COVID mask while carrying concealed. One state law makes it illegal to commit a misdemeanor while wearing a mask; however, it does not address wearing a mask while legally carrying a concealed firearm. In addition, Geauga County Sheriff Scott Hildenbrand has indicated that it is NOT ILLEGAL for a valid CCW holder to carry your weapon while wearing a mask.

### Can I carry while gun hunting?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes. A person possessing a valid concealed handgun license may carry a concealed handgun while hunting, but it may not be used to shoot, shoot at, or kill any wild animal.

### Can I carry while bow hunting?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes, with a valid Ohio Concealed Handgun License, a concealed handgun license from a state that Ohio honors, or LEOSA.

### Is there a Hunter Harassment Law?

**Question:** Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes. No person shall purposely prevent or attempt to prevent any person from lawfully hunting, trapping, or fishing for a wild animal.

### What are the knife laws in Ohio?

**Question:** What are the knife laws in Ohio?

**Answer:** Based on SB 140, which took effect on April 12, 2021, any knife or cutting instrument is defined as a weapon only if it is used as a weapon. The legislation no longer categorizes a concealed knife, razor, or cutting instrument as a “deadly weapon” or “weapon” as long as it’s not used as a weapon. So, Ohio law now allows for the ownership and open carry and concealed carry of any type of knife other than ballistic knives, which are forbidden. Knives are restricted in “School Safety Zones” which include schools, school buildings, school premises, school activities, and school buses; and courthouses or other structures in which a courtroom is located. Ohio municipalities may have additional restrictions. For example, both Akron and Cleveland prohibit the possession in public places of any knife with a blade 2 ½ inches or longer.

### Summary of California Gun Laws

California is now a shall-issue state since the Supreme Court’s ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen on June 23rd, 2022. Licenses are issued by the county sheriff’s office or local police station.

Any resident of this state who has not previously reported ownership of a firearm or anyone moving into California with a firearm is considered a “personal firearm importer” and must provide a report to the DOJ regarding their firearm or sell or transfer the firearm through a licensed dealer or to a sheriff or police department. The California Department of Justice (DOJ) runs a background check and retains information about the purchaser and seller of all in-state firearms sales and transfers.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

All firearms sales must be completed through a dealer. A permit to purchase, a background check, and a transaction report to the DOJ are required to buy a handgun. No person may sell, loan, or transfer a firearm to a minor, nor sell a handgun to an individual under 21 years of age. All ammunition purchases require a DOJ “point of sale” eligibility check with $1 paid by the consumer.

The open carry of firearms is governed in California by a set of laws that, at times, conflict with one another. Openly carrying loaded or unloaded firearms in public is generally prohibited in California. However, the sheriff of any county with a population under 200,000 people, or the chief of police of a city within that county, may issue licenses to carry a loaded, exposed handgun. Those licenses are only valid in the county where they are issued.

Concealed carry is only legal with a California Concealed Carry Weapons License (CCW). The minimum age is 18 years old, although a licensing authority has the discretion to require applicants to be older than 18 years of age. A CCWL may include any reasonable restrictions or conditions which the issuing authority deems warranted, including restrictions as to the time, place, manner, and circumstances under which the person may carry a firearm. Many areas are off-limits, including schools, courthouses, and businesses that sell alcohol for consumption. As of January 1, 2019, concealed carry licenses require a minimum eight-hour firearms training course that teaches California firearms laws and gun safety, including firing a gun in a “live-fire” shooting exercise at a shooting range. California issues carry licenses to residents, individuals who work in the state, and active duty military members permanently stationed in California. In terms of reciprocity, California does not honor any other states’ concealed carry permits.

A U.S. citizen or legal resident at least 18 years old may carry a handgun anywhere within his or her place of residence, place of business, or on private property owned or lawfully possessed by the citizen or legal resident. A permit or license is not required for a person to carry within these locations.

  * The appellate court decision that struck down California’s ban on possessing large-capacity gun magazines has been vacated as a broader panel (en banc) of the court readies to rehear the San Diego-based case. While the ban on owning large-capacity magazines stays in place for now, a lower-court ruling that prohibits enforcement of the ban while the case is being litigated also remains in effect.

### Self-Defense

California is a Castle Doctrine state. The person using the force must have reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry occurred and has no duty to retreat. Though California does not have a stand-your-ground statute, the state appellate cases have held that there is no duty to retreat before using force in public. In addition, California Criminal Jury Instructions (CALCRIM) allow a jury to acquit someone based on a stand-your-ground defense. The instruction appears in CALCRIM #505 and #506, both of which deal with justifiable homicide.

Any person using force intended or likely to cause death or great bodily injury within his or her residence shall be presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily injury to self, family, or a member of the household when that force is used against another person, not a member of the family or household, who unlawfully and forcibly enters or has unlawfully and forcibly entered the residence and the person using the force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry occurred.

There is no duty to inform a police officer that you’re carrying a concealed firearm in California. However, some counties include a must-notify restriction on licenses.

### Preemption?

Does California have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e., Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?

Yes. Most, but not all, local restrictions are preempted. Local municipalities may enact ordinances prohibiting the possession of firearms and ammunition on county-owned property, banning the discharge of firearms, and zoning. [Cal. Gov. Code § 53701]

### Red Flag Law?

Does California have a red flag law?

Yes, California has a red flag law. An immediate family member of a person, a law enforcement officer, and as of September 1, 2020, coworkers and school administrators may file a petition that includes the seizure of both firearms and ammunition. The subject of the petition is banned from having in their custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm or ammunition for anywhere from one to five years. The subject is able to submit one written request per year for a hearing to terminate the restraining order. [Cal. Pen. Code §§ 18150]

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Controlled Substances?

No consumption of alcohol is allowed. Specific controlled substances or narcotics, except when administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the state to dispense, prescribe, or administer controlled substances, are not allowed. However, CCW license conditions indicate you cannot “be under the influence of any medication or drug, whether prescribed or not”. [Cal. Health and Safety Code § 11550 and the CCWL application form]. It is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

Does California allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?

Yes.

However, other than in an act of self-defense, any person who draws or exhibits a firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, in a rude, angry, or threatening manner, or unlawfully uses a firearm in any fight or quarrel is punishable by law. [Cal. Pen. Code § 417]

Does California issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?

Contact your issuing authority for their consideration. CCWLs may be issued to individuals who work in the state and/or active duty military members permanently stationed in California.

### Driver’s License Linked to CCW License?

Is my California driver’s license linked to my California CCW license?

Yes. Although your California driver’s license is linked to your California concealed carry weapons license, that information is only included on specific types of searches that a law enforcement officer may run. You should not assume that an officer knows you are a concealed carry license holder upon contact. Additionally, CCW license conditions indicate that the licensee agrees not to refuse to show the license or surrender the concealed weapon to any peace officer upon demand.

### Possess a Handgun on My Private Property Without a License?

**Question:** Can I possess/carry a handgun in my home without a license?

**Answer:** Yes. A permit or license is not required for a legal resident over the age of 18 who resides or is temporarily within California, who is not otherwise prohibited from possessing a firearm to purchase, own, possess, keep, or carry a handgun within their residence, place of business, or lawfully possessed private property.

### List of Handguns Certified for Sale?

**Question:** Does California have a roster of handguns certified for sale?

**Answer:** Yes. As of January 1, 2001, no handgun may be manufactured within California, imported for sale, lent, given, kept for sale, or offered/exposed for sale unless that handgun model has passed firing, safety, and drop tests and is certified for sale by the Department of Justice. Private party transfers, curio/relic handguns, certain single-action revolvers, and pawn/consignment returns are exempt from this requirement.

### Handgun Purchase Process

**Question:** What is the process for purchasing a handgun in California?

**Answer:**

  * There is a limitation of purchasing no more than one handgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle in any 30-day period, with exemptions including private party transfers.
  * All firearms purchases, including private transactions, must be conducted through a federally licensed firearms dealer (FFL). Purchasers must provide their California driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, or military identification with permanent duty station orders indicating a posting in California to the FFL. Additional proof of California residency is also required.
  * Prior to the submission of Dealer Record of Sale (DROS) information, purchasers must present a Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) or provide proof of exemption (e.g., CCW license, active duty or honorably retired military, law enforcement).
  * Purchasers must complete both an ATF Form 4473 and a DROS Form. The purchaser will either be approved or, if found to be prohibited from possessing firearms, will receive a DOJ Prohibited Notice and Transfer Form.
  * The total state fee is $25, including a DROS fee of $31.19.



Note: On March 11th, 2024, a federal judge struck down the “high frequency” law citing its unconstitutionality, but allowed the law to stay in place while the state appeals the decision. Not every firearm available in the United States is legal to purchase in California. Consult the Department of Justice’s approved firearms list for a complete list of approved firearms.

### Fees:

Contact your issuing authority as fees are variable (typically at least $70).

### Valid For:

2 years.

### Residency Changes:

**Moving to California and interested in applying for a resident license? How soon can you apply?**  
California issues carry licenses to residents, individuals who work in the state, and active duty military members permanently stationed in California. You can apply for your license with your county sheriff or local police chief once you have established your residence, business, or principal place of employment in that county or city.

**Moving from California and have a California resident license? Does that license transfer to your new state? Is there a grace period during which your California license remains valid?**  
If a person with a California concealed carry weapon license establishes residency in another state, the license expires upon the establishment of the residence in the other state.

**Moving from one county in California to another county?**  
Per Pen. Code 26210, you must notify the licensing authority in writing within 10 days of any change in your place of residence. Your CCWL may not be revoked solely because your place of residence has changed to another county provided you haven’t breached any of the conditions or restrictions set forth in the license and you haven’t become prohibited by state or federal law from possessing, receiving, owning, or purchasing a firearm.

  * If your place of residence was the basis for issuance of a license, any license issued pursuant to Section 26150 or 26155 expires 90 days after you move from the county of issuance.
  * If the license is one to carry a loaded and exposed pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person, the license shall be revoked immediately upon a change of the licensee’s place of residence to another county.



### Lost/Stolen Licenses:

Contact your local county sheriff’s office or police station.

  * For a change of address. License holders must notify the Sheriff’s CCWL Unit in writing within 10 days of any change in the license holder’s place of residence. A license will expire 90 days after the license holder moves from the county where the license was originally issued if the license holder’s place of residence was the basis for issuance of the license.

### California Concealed Carry License Application Process

### Step 1:

Unlike most states that have a uniform statewide application process, the process in California is determined by each county and/or city issuing authority. You will need to contact your County Sheriff or Chief of Police to verify their application process. The process may require completion of a portion of the application so that a background check is completed and approval is received before you attend a training course. Your Sheriff or Police Department will also provide information on approved training courses/providers. Some issuing authorities have an online portal while others may not.

### Step 2:

Complete an approved training course. Depending on the issuing agency, this step may be done at the time of submitting the application or after step 6.

### Step 3:

Some jurisdictions may require psychological testing.

### Step 4:

Use the online licensing portal to submit your application or download the application and follow the instructions of your licensing authority regarding which sections to complete.

### Step 5:

Either upload the required documentation in the online portal or provide it along with your application to your Sheriff or Police Department. You may need some or all of the following:

  * Your training certificate
  * Proof of residency in your county or city
  * Original birth certificate, naturalization certificate, or valid US Passport
  * California driver’s license or California Identification card



You may be interviewed. All listed firearms may be inspected to ensure they are in a safe, legal, and operable condition. Follow the procedure of your issuing authority. Do not bring any firearms to their office unless they instruct you to do so. License fees vary. You will be required to provide Livescan/fingerprints at your issuing authority’s office or be approved to conduct Livescan/Fingerprints at a DOJ-authorized location.

### Step 6:

Upon completion of your background check, you will be notified within 90 days whether your application has been approved or denied. Please note that the timing of the background check approval varies greatly.

### License Restrictions and Conditions:

A California CCWL may include any reasonable restrictions or conditions which the issuing authority deems warranted, including restrictions as to the time, place, manner, and circumstances under which the person may carry a firearm. These restrictions must be indicated on the license itself. The license includes the licensee’s name, occupation, residence and business addresses, the licensee’s age, height, weight, color of eyes and hair, as well as a description of the weapon or weapons authorized to be carried, giving the name of the manufacturer, the serial number, and the caliber.

License holders agree to these state restrictions when they sign and submit the state application. While exercising the privileges granted under the terms of this license, the licensee shall not, when carrying a concealed weapon:

  * Consume any alcoholic beverage
  * Be in a place having a primary purpose of dispensing alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption
  * Be under the influence of any medication or drug, whether prescribed or not
  * Refuse to show the license or surrender the concealed weapon to any peace officer upon demand

  * Unjustifiably display a concealed weapon
  * Carry a concealed weapon not listed on the permit
  * Carry a concealed weapon at times or circumstances other than those specified in the permit



* * *

### California Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

### Step 1:

Renewals are the responsibility of the licensee and you may not receive any notification. Contact your issuing authority well in advance of your CCWL expiration date to determine how many days prior to expiration they recommend you submit your renewal (typically at least 30–90 days).

### Step 2:

Complete your 8-Hour CCWL Renewal Class.

### Step 3:

Additional psychological testing of an applicant seeking license renewal shall be required only if there is compelling evidence to indicate that a test is necessary.

### Step 4:

Use the online licensing portal to submit your application or download the application and follow the renewal process according to your issuing authority.

### Step 5:

You will be notified if your application has been approved or declined.

### FAQ: California Concealed Carry Questions

**Hunter Harassment Law?**

Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in California? Yes. A person shall not willfully interfere with the participation of any individual in the lawful activity of shooting, hunting, fishing, falconry, hunting dog field trials, hunting dog training, or trapping at the location where that activity is taking place. “Interfere with” is defined as any action which physically impedes, hinders, or obstructs the lawful pursuit of any of the above-mentioned activities. [FGC § 2009]

**What Are the Knife Laws in California?**

All legal fixed-blade knives must be worn in plain view, except knives classified as dirks or daggers, which cannot be carried concealed and must be carried openly on a sheath around your waist. There is no open carry size limit for legal knives, although there may be local restrictions. Certain knives, including pocketknives with blades shorter than 2 inches, may be carried concealed as long as the blade is folded in the closed position. Switchblades with a blade longer than 2 inches are illegal to sell, carry and possess in any motor vehicle on public property. There are a number of types of knives that are illegal, including but not limited to ballistic knives, cane swords, billies, blackjacks, sandbags, sandclubs, saps, slungshots and nunchaku. [Cal. Penal Code §§ 21510, 21310, 21110, 22210 & 22010]

**Carry While Gun Hunting?**

Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in California? Yes. Section 25400 does not apply to, or affect, licensed hunters or fishermen carrying pistols, revolvers, or other firearms capable of being concealed upon the person while engaged in hunting or fishing. However, these individuals may not carry or transport loaded firearms when going to or from the expedition. The unloaded firearms should be transported in the trunk of the vehicle or in a locked container other than the utility or glove compartment. [Cal. Penal Code §§ 25610 and 25640]

**Possess Firearms at Walt Disney Resorts?**

Can you have a firearm at any Walt Disney Resort Properties? No. Firearms, ammunition, knives and weapons of any kind are prohibited at all Walt Disney World Resorts. This includes parking areas.

**Carry While Bow Hunting?**

Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in California? No. The California Fish and Game Commission voted to approve a petition submitted by NRA and CRPA attorneys seeking to allow big game archery hunters to carry a firearm for the purposes of self-defense while in the field. However, the Commission’s decision does not change the restriction as applied to deer hunting. A state statute outside of the Commission’s control prohibits any person other than specified law enforcement from carrying a firearm of any kind while archery hunting for deer.

**Wear a COVID Mask & Carry?**

I can legally carry a concealed firearm in California, but can I wear a COVID 19 protective mask while carrying concealed? California is one of just two states with statutes against carrying a concealed firearm while wearing a mask (the other being Illinois). However the law specifies that a person commits criminal possession of a firearm when the person carries a firearm in a public place or on any public street while masked so as to hide the person’s identity (which isn’t generally the intention during the COVID pandemic). However, since there is no exemption for wearing a mask for public health or medical reasons, contact your issuing authority with any questions. [Cal. Penal Code § 25300(a)]

### Summary of Arizona Gun Laws

Arizona is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with concealed weapons permits issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety.

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual. A purchaser must be at least 18 years old to buy a gun from a private individual. The minimum age to purchase a handgun from a federally licensed dealer is 21.

Open carry is legal in Arizona for any person who is at least 18 years old and who can legally possess a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and liquor stores that have posted “no weapons” signs.

Anyone at least 21 years old who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Arizona Concealed Weapons Permits (CWP) are issued to residents and non-residents at least 21 years old or 19 for active military and veterans and require a state-approved firearms training course, although there are training exemptions that may apply to law enforcement and members of the military. Since Arizona has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

A person is justified in threatening or using physical force when and to the extent a reasonable person would believe that physical force is immediately necessary to protect themselves or a third party against the other’s use or attempted use of unlawful physical force.

### Use of Deadly Force

A person is justified in threatening or using physical force or deadly force against another if such person would be justified in threatening or using physical force against the other; and when and to the degree a reasonable person would believe that deadly physical force is immediately necessary to protect themselves or a third party against the other’s use or attempted use of unlawful deadly physical force.

### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Premises

A person in lawful possession or control of premises is justified in threatening to use physical force when and to the extent that a reasonable person would believe it immediately necessary to prevent or terminate criminal trespass in or upon the premises.

“Premises” means any real property and any structure — movable or immovable, permanent or temporary — adapted for both human residence and lodging whether occupied or not.

### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property

A person is justified in using physical force when and to the extent that a reasonable person would believe it necessary to prevent theft or criminal damage involving tangible movable property. A person may use deadly force only in the defense of themselves or a third person.

### Carry Locations in Arizona

### Carry at Roadside Rest Areas

**Question:** Can you carry a concealed firearm at roadside rest areas in Arizona?

**Answer:** Yes.

### Carry in State/National Parks, State/National Forests, and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs)

**Question:** Can you carry a concealed firearm in state/national parks, state/national forests, and Wildlife Management Areas in Arizona?

**Answer:** Yes, although firearms are not allowed in any building where a federal or state office is located.

### Carry/Possess at a Hotel

**Question:** Can you carry or possess a firearm on hotel property in Arizona?

**Answer:** Arizona statutes don’t specifically address firearms at hotels. Each hotel develops its own policies, so you should contact the individual hotel to inquire about its concealed carry policy.

### Store in a Vehicle in an Employee Parking Lot

**Question:** Does Arizona have laws relating to storing firearms in private vehicles in an employee parking lot?

**Answer:** Firearms can legally be carried in a case, holster, scabbard, pack, or luggage that is carried within a means of transportation or within a storage compartment, map pocket, trunk, or glove compartment of a means of transportation.

A property owner, tenant, public or private employer, or business entity cannot enforce a policy that prohibits a person who can legally possess a firearm from lawfully transporting or storing any firearm that is both:

  1. In the person’s locked and privately owned motor vehicle or in a locked compartment on the person’s privately owned motorcycle; and
  2. Not visible from the outside of the motor vehicle or motorcycle.



This section does not apply if:

  * The property owner provides a parking lot secured by a fence or other physical barrier;
  * Limits access by a guard or other security measure;
  * Provides temporary and secure firearm storage that is monitored and accessible upon entry and exit from the premises; or
  * Provides alternative parking reasonably proximate to the primary parking area without charging an extra fee.



### Carry in Bars/Restaurants that Serve Alcohol

**Question:** Can you carry a concealed firearm in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol in Arizona?

**Answer:** Arizona’s statutes are contradictory. ARS § 4–229(A) indicates no permit is required to carry concealed in a bar/restaurant that serves alcohol. However, ARS §§ 4–244(29) and (30) indicate that concealed carry is legal with or without a permit, unless posted otherwise and provided you don’t consume any alcohol.

### Carry in a Vehicle

**Question:** Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in Arizona?

**Answer:** Yes, for anyone that is 21 years old and legally entitled to carry a firearm, no permit is required. Firearms must be in plain view from outside the vehicle for anyone under 21 years old.

However, LEOs may have access to other databases where they can obtain this information.

### Preemption?

**Does Arizona have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e. does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?**

Yes. There is full state preemption of all gun laws. Section 13–3108 provides that if a court determines a political subdivision has knowingly violated the preemption law, the court may assess a civil penalty of up to $50,000. If a court determines that a state official enacting a law or rule knowingly violated the preemption law, that person’s term may be subject to termination.

### Red Flag Law?

**Does Arizona have a red flag law?**

No. Arizona does not have a red flag law.

**Does Arizona allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?**

No, the information is available only to criminal justice agencies.

### Carry While Consuming Alcohol?

**Does Arizona have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while consuming alcohol?**

No consumption allowed. As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### “No Weapons Allowed” Signs Enforced?

**Are “No Weapons Allowed” signs enforced in Arizona?**

Yes. A person commits misconduct involving weapons by knowingly entering any public establishment or attending any public event carrying a deadly weapon after a reasonable request by the operator or sponsor to remove the weapon and place it in secure storage. Misconduct involving weapons is a class 1 misdemeanor. Additionally, Arizona law permits private business owners to prohibit weapons from being brought onto their property, whether signs are posted or not. Failure to obey the request can result in arrest for trespassing.

### Duty to Inform Officer You’re Carrying?

**Do you have a duty to notify a police officer that you’re carrying a concealed firearm in Arizona?**

No. You have no duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you are carrying a concealed weapon unless the officer asks.

### Brandishing?

**Does Arizona state law define brandishing?**

No definition of brandishing was found in Arizona law. However, a person commits the crime of disorderly conduct if they recklessly handle, display, or discharge a deadly weapon. Defensive displays of a firearm without justification could also be charged as aggravated assault. Defensive displays include actions such as putting your hand on a firearm while it is concealed in a pocket, sweeping the jacket to expose the firearm, or saying you have a firearm without drawing or waving it. Arizona statutes specifically allow defensive displays and protect a citizen against being prosecuted for it when it is justified.

### Non-Resident Permitting?

**Does Arizona issue concealed carry permits to non-residents?**

Yes.

### License Renewal Steps

**Step 1:** Renewals are the responsibility of the permittee. At least 45 days prior to the expiration date of a concealed carry permit, the sheriff will send a written notice to the permittee explaining that the permit is about to expire. If the holder of the permit applies to renew the permit before it expires, the permit will remain valid beyond the expiration date of the permit until the permittee either receives a renewal permit or is denied a renewal permit by the sheriff. If the permittee does not apply to renew the permit prior to its expiration date, but does apply to renew the permit within 60 days after the permit expires, the sheriff may waive the requirement of taking another firearms safety course; however, the person may not carry a concealed handgun under this expired permit. You should begin filing an application for renewal with your county sheriff’s office at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the original permit.

A concealed handgun permit holder who is or will be deployed for military service is allowed to apply with the sheriff for an extension of the concealed handgun permit up to an additional 90 days after the permittee’s scheduled deployment is to end.

**Step 2:** Download an application.

**Step 3:** Submit your completed application to your local sheriff’s office along with the following:

### Permitless Carry Law

As of July 1, 2021, Tennessee enacted a law allowing permitless open and concealed carry for individuals aged 18 and older, who can lawfully possess a handgun, provided they are in a place they have the right to be and meet additional specified criteria. Some areas remain off-limits, including government buildings and schools.

### Legal Challenge and Changes

In April 2021, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) filed a lawsuit against Tennessee’s restrictions on 18- to 20-year-olds carrying concealed firearms in public. On January 23, 2023, the state and FPC reached an agreement in federal court stating these restrictions were unconstitutional and immediately ceased enforcement.

### Tennessee Concealed Handgun Carry Permits

Since January 1, 2020, Tennessee offers two levels of concealed handgun carry permits:

  * **Concealed Handgun Carry Permit (CHCP)** : Requires a 90-minute online course.
  * **Enhanced Handgun Carry Permit (EHCP)** : Requires completion of an 8-hour live training course, allowing permittees to carry openly or concealed in more locations.



Non-residents who work regularly in Tennessee and hold a valid concealed carry permit in their home state may apply for a CHCP after six months of employment.

### Reciprocity

Tennessee recognizes concealed carry permits from all other states.

### Self-Defense Laws

Tennessee adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and has a “stand your ground” law:

  * Individuals lawfully present and not engaged in illegal activity have no duty to retreat before using or threatening force likely to cause serious bodily injury or death.
  * Deadly force used within a residence, business, dwelling, or vehicle is presumed justified against an intruder unlawfully and forcibly entering.



### Definitions

  * **Dwelling** : Includes any structure with a roof, designed for human use.
  * **Residence** : A dwelling where a person resides temporarily or permanently.
  * **Vehicle** : Self-propelled motor vehicles for public highway use.



[Tenn. Code. Ann. §§ 39–11–611, 39–11–612, 39–11–614]

> Legal information provided is for reference and not legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific legal concerns.

Oregon operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, managed at the county level by local sheriff’s offices. The sheriff holds discretion to deny a permit if there are reasonable grounds to believe the applicant poses a danger to themselves or others.

### Firearm Purchase and Transfer Regulations

No license is required for firearm purchases in Oregon. Private-party transfers must occur through a licensed dealer, with both parties present. Federal law mandates background checks and record-keeping by the dealer, and the Oregon State Police retain records of firearm sales for five years.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Oregon without a permit for individuals aged 18 and older. However, local jurisdictions retain the authority to impose restrictions on open carry, including in public spaces and vehicles. Certain areas like federal facilities and Indian reservations are off-limits for carrying firearms.

### Oregon Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

Concealed carry is permissible with an Oregon CHL, available to applicants aged 21 and above.

Oregon law permits the use of physical force in self-defense or defense of others against imminent unlawful physical force. Individuals may use force they reasonably believe necessary to prevent or terminate theft, criminal trespass, or burglary.

### Self-Defense and Deadly Force

Oregon law does not explicitly include a Castle Doctrine or “stand your ground” provision. However, individuals are not required to retreat before using force in self-defense in public spaces. Deadly force is justified to prevent certain felonies involving physical force, burglary in a dwelling, or imminent unlawful deadly physical force against oneself or others.

### Use of Deadly Physical Force

The use of deadly physical force is justified in Oregon when preventing a felony involving physical force, burglary in a dwelling, or imminent unlawful deadly physical force. It may also be used to defend against arson or a felony committed with force and violence.

### Summary of Rhode Island Gun Laws

Rhode Island operates under a shall-issue framework for concealed carry licenses, though the attorney general also has discretionary authority (“may-issue”). Licenses are issued either by local police chiefs or the attorney general.

Under state law:

  * Local law enforcement must issue licenses to eligible applicants if they are deemed suitable and have a valid reason for carrying a handgun.
  * The attorney general may issue licenses to individuals aged 21 or older who demonstrate a specific need and prove their ability to handle a handgun. This license may be issued to undocumented individuals as well.

### Handgun Purchase and Background Checks

To purchase a handgun in Rhode Island:

  * A Rhode Island License to Carry Concealed Weapons (LCCW) or a “blue card” from the RI Department of Environmental Management is required.
  * A background check through the state police or local chief of police is mandatory for private handgun purchases.
  * Firearms registration is not mandatory in Rhode Island.



### Concealed and Open Carry Laws

  * Open carry is legal only with an LCCW issued by the attorney general. Local authorities issue licenses strictly for concealed carry.
  * Applicants must justify their need for a firearm and provide three notarized references. A firearms training course with a live-firing test is mandatory.
  * Non-residents with a valid permit from their home state can apply for an LCCW through local law enforcement. The attorney general may issue LCCWs to non-residents without home state permits.
  * Certain locations are off-limits for carrying firearms, such as state parks and federal buildings.



### Self-Defense Laws in Rhode Island

Rhode Island follows the Castle Doctrine:

  * There is no duty to retreat for the owner, tenant, or occupier of a place when facing a threat and may use reasonable means of self-defense.
  * It is legally presumed in any civil or criminal proceeding that the use of force in self-defense was justified against someone committing specific criminal offenses, such as burglary or intent to commit murder.



These laws afford individuals legal protections when using force in self-defense within their homes or places of lawful occupancy.

### Open Carry and Concealed Carry

Open carry is not explicitly addressed in New York state law. A New York Pistol License (NYPL) is required to possess a loaded handgun outside of the home or place of business. Concealed carry is legal only with a NYPL. The minimum age is 21, except for honorably discharged military members, who can apply at any age.

### Licensing Requirements

Residents, part-time residents, or individuals principally employed or conducting business in New York can obtain NYPLs. Pistol licenses issued by New York City are valid statewide, with the exception of the five counties within New York City where specific city validation is required.

### Restrictions and Reciprocity

New York does not recognize permits/licenses from any other states. Certain areas like schools and courthouses are off-limits for carrying handguns. Various types of NYPLs are available, with common ones including concealed carry and possess on premises licenses, which may have specific endorsements or restrictions.

### Self-Defense Laws

New York follows a self-defense law based on the Castle Doctrine. Individuals have a duty to retreat from attackers if they can safely do so. The use of physical force is permitted in self-defense, defense of others, and defense of property from crimes like larceny or criminal mischief.

### Use of Deadly Force

Deadly force is justifiable in New York when defending against imminent threats involving deadly physical force, kidnapping, forcible sexual acts, robbery, arson, or burglary, provided retreat is not safely possible.

### License Renewal and Recertification

Pistol or revolver licenses issued by New York City, Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk counties expire and require renewal every three years. Licenses issued outside these areas do not expire but must be recertified with the New York State Police every three years for concealed carry licenses.

### Carry in Vehicle?

  * Has been purchased from a licensed dealer within New York City and is being transported out of the city immediately from the dealer by the licensee in a locked container during a continuous and uninterrupted trip; or

### Preemption?

Does New York have preemption laws related to concealed carry?

Yes. There is partial preemption primarily for handgun licensing. New York laws confer power upon local governments to adopt laws related to the protection, order, conduct, safety, health, and well-being of persons or property. However, local laws may not conflict with the state constitution or general laws. [N.Y. Pen. Law § 400.00(6)]

### Red Flag Law?

[N.Y. Civil Practice Law & Rules Article 63-A]

### Brandishing?

No definition of brandishing was found in New York law. However, a person is guilty of menacing in the second degree when they intentionally place or attempt to place another person in reasonable fear of physical injury, serious physical injury, or death by displaying a deadly weapon, dangerous instrument, or what appears to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm. [N.Y. Penal Law § 120.14]

A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, they engage in fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior. [N.Y. Penal Law § 240.20]

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?

Does New York have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?

Not addressed in state statutes.

**Is a permit required to purchase a handgun in New York?** Yes, a permit is required for handguns. A concealed carry license or a permit to possess a pistol or revolver is necessary to purchase a handgun. However, no permit is required for long guns.

### Background Checks for Private Gun Sales

**Are background checks required for private gun sales in New York? Are there exceptions?** Yes. For firearms transfers between private parties, a licensed dealer must conduct a background check, provide documentation of the check to the New York State Police, and keep a record of the transaction. There is an exception for transfers between immediate family members.

### New York License Exempts from Background Check

**Does my current New York concealed carry license exempt me from needing a background check when I purchase a firearm?** No.

### Handgun Registration

**Do handguns need to be registered in New York?** Yes, all handguns need to be registered. There is no registration for long guns. Handguns are identified on a person’s NY Pistol license by caliber, make, model, manufacturer’s name, and serial number. The license also indicates if the handgun may be carried on the person or possessed in a particular location. A license holder may apply at any time to their local licensing officer to amend their license to add newly purchased handguns or remove handguns they have sold.

### Handgun Purchase Process

**What is the process for purchasing a handgun in New York?** New York law requires that a NICS background check be completed by a licensed firearms dealer before the sale, exchange, or disposal of any firearm, unless the transaction is between members of an immediate family. Before taking possession of a firearm, you must supply the dealer with a purchase document obtained from the County Police Pistol License section. This document requires a bill of sale from the dealer, which includes the make, model, type, caliber, and serial number of the firearm, plus confirmation the purchaser has passed a NICS background check.

Upon completion of the background check by the licensed dealer, the dealer must finalize a document confirming the check was performed. All dealers must maintain transaction records on their premises and the records must be open at all reasonable hours for inspection by law enforcement. A dealer may charge a fee of up to $10.00 per transaction.

Purchase documents are valid for 20 days. The firearm must be presented to the state licensing unit within that period for inspection so it can be entered into the database.

### New York Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

### What is the process for pistol license recertification in New York?

Recertification is the responsibility of the licensee. The pistol license recertification provision of the SAFE Act, passed by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor in 2013, aims to strengthen and improve the accuracy of record keeping at both the state and local levels. License holders were reminded of the January 31, 2018, deadline through letters, the press, and social media.

The State Police are working to process all recertifications and update their database, a process expected to take between 9–12 months. After this period, local licensing authorities will be provided with updated, accurate licensing information. The goal is compliance, so the State Police will not take criminal enforcement action against individuals who have unknowingly failed to recertify; instead, they will continue to accept recertifications throughout 2018.

If you have a New York City, Nassau County, Suffolk County, or Westchester County license, you must follow the requirements in place in your county, rather than using the New York State recertification system.

### How do I recertify my pistol license?

Recertification can only be done online. Paper forms are no longer accepted.

### What information do I need to provide during recertification?

Complete the form with your updated contact information.

### FAQ: New York Concealed Carry Questions

It is legal to openly carry or conceal any legal knife provided there is no intent for unlawful use against another person. It is illegal to own a switchblade, pilum ballistic knife, metal knuckle knife, cane sword, and any knife adapted for use primarily as a weapon in New York. While it is legal for a U.S. citizen not previously convicted of any crime to own a gravity knife (as of May 30, 2019), dirk, dagger, dangerous knife, razor, or stiletto, it is illegal to carry them with the intent of unlawful use against another.

A weapon or dangerous instrument includes, but is not limited to, a firearm, switchblade knife, gravity knife, box cutter, straight razor or razor blades that are not wrapped or enclosed in a protective covering, and a sword. Shotguns and rifles that are unloaded and carried in an enclosed case, box, or other container which completely conceals the item from view and identification as a weapon are allowed.

### Wear a COVID mask & carry?

### Summary of New Hampshire Gun Laws

New Hampshire operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Residents apply to the local law enforcement office and non-residents to the State Department of Justice for a Pistol/Revolver License (PRL).

There is no permit, background check, or firearms registration required to purchase a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal in New Hampshire without a license for individuals at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. While there is no minimum age to carry a firearm under state law, federal law requires individuals to be at least 18 years old. Pistol/Revolver Licenses (PRLs) are issued to residents and non-residents primarily for reciprocity purposes. No fingerprinting or photograph is necessary for a PRL. New Hampshire law does not mandate firearms safety training or proficiency demonstration for license applicants. With permitless carry in place, any person aged 18 and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry concealed without a license or permit.

### Self-Defense Laws

New Hampshire implements a Castle Doctrine and “stand your ground” law. Individuals lawfully present in a place and facing a threat of bodily harm or death are not obligated to retreat before using force.

### Use of Force in Defense of Premises

A person in control of premises, or who is licensed or privileged to be there, may use non-deadly force to prevent or stop criminal trespassing. Deadly force may be used to defend against a person or to prevent arson, but only under circumstances where non-deadly force is insufficient.

### Civil Immunity

Individuals who use force in self-defense, defense of others, protection of premises, law enforcement, or for the care of minors are immune from civil liability for injuries sustained by an aggressor.

[N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 627:4, 62:5, 627:6, 627:7, and 627:1a]

### Physical Force in Defense of a Person

Non-deadly force is justified to defend oneself or others against imminent unlawful force. Deadly force is justified if one reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent:

  * Unlawful deadly force against oneself or another person.
  * Any unlawful force during a burglary or forcible sex offense.
  * Unlawful force during the commission of a felony within one’s dwelling or its curtilage.



Deadly force is not justified if safe retreat is possible, the person is not the initial aggressor, or other alternatives are available.

The terms “curtilage” and “dwelling” are defined to include structures closely associated with overnight accommodation and surrounding grounds habitually used for domestic purposes.

These laws apply regardless of whether the individual is physically present.

### Self-Defense Laws in Texas

  * **Castle Doctrine** : No duty to retreat from any place where one has the legal right to be, when using force or deadly force to defend oneself or others.
  * **Defense of Person** : Deadly force is justified if the actor reasonably believes it is immediately necessary to prevent certain felonies or threats.
  * **Defense of Property** : Use of force, including deadly force, is justified to protect one’s property under specific circumstances.
  * **Presumption of Reasonableness** : Texas law presumes that using deadly force in defense of habitation, vehicle, or business against unlawful intrusion or felony is reasonable.
  * **Using Force** : Justified when necessary to protect against unlawful force, with a presumption of reasonableness under certain conditions.



For specific legal references, consult the Texas Penal Code (§§ 9.31, 9.32, 9.33, 9.41, 9.42 & 9.43).

### Carry Locations FAQ

**STORE IN A VEHICLE IN AN EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT?**

Does Texas have laws relating to storing firearms in private vehicles in an employee parking lot?

A public or private employer may not prohibit an employee who holds a valid concealed carry license from transporting or storing a firearm or ammunition they are authorized to possess in a locked, privately owned motor vehicle in a parking area the employer provides for employees, except where prohibited by state or federal law. This includes school districts or open-enrollment charter schools per Texas Education Code § 37.0815 and institutions of higher education per Gov. Code § 411.2032, provided that the firearm or ammunition is not in plain view. There are exceptions, including oil and gas refineries. [Tex. Labor Code § 52.061]

**CARRY IN VEHICLE?**

Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in Texas?

Yes, without a license as of Sept. 1, 2021. However, it is an offense if the handgun is in plain view, unless it is in a holster and you are either 21 years old or have a Texas LTC or a permit that Texas honors, provided you are not engaging in criminal activity (other than a traffic violation). There are exemptions for peace officers, military, and other security and governmental professionals. [Texas Penal Code §§ 46.02(a-1) and 46.15]

**CARRY AT ROADSIDE REST AREAS?**

Can you carry a concealed firearm at roadside rest areas in Texas?

Yes, without a license for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun.

**CARRY IN STATE/NATIONAL PARKS, STATE/NATIONAL FORESTS AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREAS (WMAS)?**

Can you carry a concealed firearm in state/national parks, state/national forests, and Wildlife Management Areas in Texas?

Yes, without a license for anyone at least 21 years old who may lawfully possess a handgun. See the National Parks webpage for links to each Park in Texas. Except no firearms are allowed on or across the land of the Lower Colorado River Authority [Tex. Parks & Wild. Code § 62.081], on or over the water of Murvaul Lake in Panola County [Texas Parks and Wild. Code § 283.022], or in specific game sanctuaries listed under Texas Parks and Wild. Code.

**CARRY IN BARS/RESTAURANTS THAT SERVE ALCOHOL?**

Can you carry a concealed firearm in bars and restaurants that serve alcohol in Texas?

Carry is prohibited in businesses that sell alcoholic beverages for on-premise consumption, whose alcohol sales constitute more than 50% of gross receipts, and display a red sign with “51%” in large red letters superimposed over a warning that possession of a concealed weapon on the premises is a felony. As of Sept. 1, 2021, only permit holders have a legal defense if effective notice is not given by the business. You can concealed carry in the restaurant area of an eatery that serves alcohol (those that make less than 51% of their profits from alcohol) without a license. [Texas Penal Code § 46.03(p)]

**CARRY/POSSESS AT A HOTEL?**

As of September 1, 2021, unless prohibited by state or federal law, a hotel may not adopt a policy prohibiting a hotel guest from:

* * *

### Key State Laws

**DRIVER’S LICENSE LINKED TO Carry License?**

  * Is my Texas driver’s license linked to my Texas carry license?
  * Yes. Texas does show if the registered driver of the car has a license to carry (LTC). So when pulled over, the license plate trace shows that data. If the DL is run independently of a license plate it will also show that you have a LTC.



**“No Weapons Allowed” Signs Enforced?**

  * Are “No Weapons Allowed” signs enforced in Texas?
  * Yes. As of Sept. 1, 2021, signage is complicated in Texas, and anyone carrying a firearm will need to understand the differences between the definitions of each sign. The Firearm Carry Act of 2021 creates two additional weapons signs: Texas Penal Code § 30.05 signs will indicate locations where just permitless carry of firearms is prohibited. It will be up to private individuals and businesses to decide what their policies will be moving forward regarding permitless carriers. Texas Penal Code § 30.06 signs that indicate locations where concealed carry permit holders cannot carry; Texas Penal Code § 30.07 signs that indicate locations where open carry for permit holders is prohibited; and 51% signs that indicate the establishment sells alcohol by the drink and receives more than 51% of its income from alcohol sales. Only concealed carry permit holders have a legal defense if effective notice has not been provided. [Texas Penal Code § 46.15(p)] Texas Penal Code § 46.03(o) signs will state “Pursuant to Section 46.03, Penal Code (places weapons prohibited), a person may not carry a firearm or other weapon on this property.” If this sign is posted in a conspicuous location, no firearms are allowed. Regardless of which sign is posted, once a person receives effective consent (either verbal or written notice) that entry on the property is prohibited, he or she must promptly leave or risk being charged with a misdemeanor. [Texas Penal Code § 30.05]



**Red Flag Law?**

  * Does Texas have a red flag law?
  * No. Texas does not have a red flag law.



**Brandishing?**

  * Does Texas state law define brandishing?
  * No definition of brandishing was found in Texas law. However, a person commits disorderly conduct if he or she intentionally or knowingly displays a firearm or other deadly weapon in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm. [Tex. Pen. Code § 42.01]



**NON-RESIDENT PERMITTING?**

  * Does Texas issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?
  * Yes. The process is the same as for residents.



**PUBLIC ACCESS TO CONCEALED CARRY REGISTRY?**

  * Does Texas allow the public to access concealed carry registry information through public records law?
  * No, however, the information is available to any criminal justice agency.



**Preemption?**

  * Does Texas have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e. Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?
  * Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Texas, except local municipalities may: Regulate the discharge of firearms within their limits, other than at a sport shooting range; Regulate the carrying of a firearm or air gun by a person other than a person licensed to carry a concealed handgun under Texas law at: A public park; A public meeting of a municipality, county, or other governmental body; A political rally, parade or official political meeting; and A non-firearms-related school, college, or professional athletic event. In addition, in any county building that houses a justice court, county court, county court at law, or district court, or in any office used by these courts, any person who possesses a firearm without the court’s written authorization, or without complying with any written regulation of the court, is subject to criminal liability. Based on an Attorney General opinion, counties may prohibit concealed handgun license holders from carrying concealed handguns in county parks and rapid transit authorities may prohibit concealed handgun licensees from carrying handguns while on public transportation. [Tex. Local Gov’t Code § 229.001(b)(6)][Tex. Local Gov’t Code § 291.010(c)]



**Duty to Inform Officer You’re Carrying?**

  * Do you have a duty to inform a police officer that you’re carrying a concealed firearm in Texas?
  * You have a duty to inform a law enforcement officer that you’re carrying a concealed firearm in Texas when an officer demands that you display identification, you must display both your driver’s license or identification and your handgun license. [Tex. Gov’t Code § 411.205]



**Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?**

  * Does Texas have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs?
  * As of Sept. 1, 2021, carry is prohibited if you are intoxicated anywhere other than: On your own property or property under your control or on private property with the consent of the owner; or Inside of or directly en route to a motor vehicle or watercraft: That is owned by you or under your control; or That is owned by you or under your control; or With the consent of the owner or operator of the vehicle or watercraft. [Texas Penal Code § 46.02(a-6)] “Intoxicated” is defined as: Not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol, a controlled substance, a drug, a dangerous drug, a combination of two or more of those substances, or any other substance into the body; or Having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more. [Texas Penal Code § 49.01(2)] As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

### Summary of Kentucky Gun Laws

Kentucky is a shall-issue, permitless carry state with licenses processed by the State Police.

No license is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. A background check is required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Dealer.

Open carry is legal in Kentucky without a license for anyone at least 18 years of age who is not prohibited from possessing a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including businesses primarily devoted to the sale of alcohol.

Kentucky is now a permitless carry state, so concealed carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years old who can legally possess a firearm without a license/permit. Those wanting to conceal carry out-of-state will still need to get a conceal carry license. Kentucky concealed carry licenses are referred to as Concealed Carry of Deadly Weapons (CCDW) licenses, and they apply to not only handguns but also knives, clubs, blackjacks, nunchaku, shuriken, and brass knuckles. Successful completion of a state-approved firearms training course is required to obtain a CCDW license. CCDW licenses are available to residents and military personnel stationed in Kentucky. Licenses are not available for non-residents. In terms of reciprocity, Kentucky recognizes all currently valid concealed carry permits issued by other U.S. jurisdictions.

### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Self or a Third Party

The use of physical force by a person is justifiable when the person believes that such force is necessary to protect themselves or a third party against the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force. The use of deadly force by a person is justifiable only when the person believes that such force is necessary to protect themselves or a third party against imminent death, serious physical injury, kidnapping, sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat, or another felony involving the use of force.

### Defense of Dwelling, Residence, or Occupied Vehicle

A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm when using deadly force to prevent or terminate another’s unlawful entry upon such person’s dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle, or an attempt to remove another against that person’s will from the dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle.

### Protection of Property

The use of physical force by a person is justifiable when the person believes that such force is immediately necessary to prevent:

  * The commission of criminal trespass, robbery, burglary, or other felony involving the use of force in a dwelling, building, or upon real property in his or her possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection one acts; or
  * Theft, criminal mischief, or any unlawful taking of tangible, movable property in his or her possession or in the possession of another person for whose protection one acts.



The use of deadly force by a defendant upon another person is justifiable only when the defendant believes that the person against whom such force is used is:

  * Attempting to dispossess him or her of the dwelling otherwise than under a claim of right to its possession;
  * Committing or attempting to commit a burglary, robbery, or other felony involving the use of force; or
  * Committing or attempting to commit arson of a dwelling or other building in his or her possession.

### Self-Defense

Kentucky is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where they have a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand their ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if they reasonably believe it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the commission of a felony involving the use of force.

### Justification and Criminal and Civil Immunity

A person who uses permitted force is justified in using such force and is immune from criminal prosecution and civil action, unless the person against whom the force was used is a peace officer.

### Summary of Maryland Gun Laws

Maryland is now a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court’s ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen case on June 23rd, 2022. The issuance of concealed weapons permits is managed at the state level by the Secretary of the Maryland State Police.

### Handgun Purchase Requirements

To buy a handgun from a private individual in Maryland, a permit to purchase, background check, and firearms registration are mandatory. Private firearms sellers must conduct transfers through a licensed dealer or designated law enforcement agency, which then performs a background check. Maryland also maintains a handgun roster that limits the sale of handguns to those listed, with some exceptions.

### Concealed Carry Regulations

Concealed carry in Maryland is permitted only for holders of Maryland Wear/Carry Handgun Permits (WCHP). Open carry was prohibited as of October 1, 2023. Applicants for a WCHP must be at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for employment purposes only) and must complete a state-approved 16-hour firearms training course including live-fire training. Additional training is required at each renewal of the WCHP.

### Restrictions and Reciprocity

Maryland restricts carry in certain areas such as rest areas and state parks. The state does not recognize permits from other states (reciprocity).

### Self-Defense Laws

Maryland adheres to common law principles resembling Castle Doctrine principles. There is a duty to retreat, meaning individuals must attempt to retreat or avoid danger before resorting to deadly force in self-defense. Deadly force is justified only when faced with immediate danger of serious injury or death, provided certain conditions are met, including reasonable belief of imminent danger and non-provocation.

Under Maryland Code, individuals are protected from liability for personal injury or death of an intruder in their dwelling or place of business if they reasonably believe force or deadly force is necessary to repel an attack and if the force used is deemed reasonable under the circumstances.

### Summary of Nebraska Gun Laws

Nebraska is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Permits are issued at the state level by the State Patrol Department.

A handgun certificate or a concealed carry permit is required for any purchase of a handgun, including private sales. The city of Omaha mandates handgun registration, although concealed handgun permit holders are exempt.

Open carry is legal without a permit in Nebraska for anyone at least 18 years old who is not prohibited from possessing a firearm, though local governments may impose restrictions. For open carry in a vehicle, the firearm must be clearly visible. Some areas, including schools, are off-limits. In Omaha, individuals must possess a concealed carry permit to openly carry within the city.

Concealed carry is legal for residents with a Nebraska Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) and for non-residents with a license/permit from a state Nebraska honors. On April 25, 2023, Gov. Jim Pillen (R) signed LB 77 into law, making Nebraska the 27th constitutional carry state in the U.S. The new law is now in effect. A person, other than a minor or a prohibited person, may carry a concealed handgun anywhere in Nebraska, with or without a permit under the Concealed Handgun Permit Act Section 69–2441.

The minimum age to obtain a CHP is 21 years old. Applicants must complete a firearms training course. Permits are restricted to residents and military personnel and their spouses stationed in Nebraska. The city of Lincoln prohibits the possession of a firearm by anyone convicted of certain misdemeanors within the last 10 years, including stalking, violation of an order of protection, sexual assault, and public indecency. Nebraska recognizes permits issued by states with standards equal to or greater than Nebraska.

### Use of Force for Protection of Property

The use of force is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary:

  * To prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or other trespass upon land or a trespass against or the unlawful carrying away of tangible, movable property.
  * To effect an entry or re-entry upon land or to retake tangible movable property.



[Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 28–1409, 28–1410, and 28–1411]

### Self-Defense

Nebraska is a Castle Doctrine state. There is no duty to retreat while in a person’s dwelling or workplace. Present law requires citizens, if outside their homes, vehicles, or outbuildings, to retreat before protecting themselves or family against violent intruders.

### Use of Force for Protection of Other Persons

The use of force is justifiable to protect a third person when:

  * The actor would be justified in using such force to protect himself or herself against the injury he or she believes to be threatened to the person whom one seeks to protect.
  * Under the circumstances, the person whom he or she seeks to protect would be justified in using such protective force.
  * The actor believes that his or her intervention is necessary for the protection of such other person.



A person is not required to retreat before using force in the protection of another person against the use of unlawful force unless one knows that he can thereby secure the complete safety of such other person. However, there is no duty to retreat when in the other’s dwelling or place of work.

In addition, § NRS 28–1413 refers to the use of force by persons with special responsibility for the care, discipline, or safety of others.

### Use of Force in Self-Protection

The use of force upon or toward another person is justifiable:

  * When the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary to protect himself against the use of unlawful force by such other person on the present occasion.
  * When the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping, or sexual intercourse compelled by force or threat.
  * To resist force used by the occupier or possessor of property if:
  * The actor has been unlawfully dispossessed of the property and is making a re-entry or recapture justified by section 28–1411.
  * The actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily harm.



The use of deadly force is not justifiable if:

  * The actor provoked the use of force against himself or herself in the same encounter.
  * The actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating, surrendering possession of an item, or by complying with a demand that he or she abstain from any action which one has no duty to take, except that:
  * The actor shall not be obliged to retreat from his or her dwelling or place of work unless the person was the initial aggressor or is assailed in the place of work by another person whose place of work the actor knows it to be.

### Summary of Oklahoma Gun Laws

Oklahoma operates as a shall-issue, permitless carry state where licenses are processed locally by the county sheriff’s office.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Oklahoma without a license for individuals who are at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for members or veterans of the U.S. military). This is permitted for self-defense, hunting, fishing, educational, or recreational purposes. Certain locations, such as public government buildings, are restricted.

### Permitless Carry

Oklahoma allows permitless carry for individuals who are at least 21 years old (or 18 years old for military members or honorably discharged veterans) and legally eligible to own a firearm. This allows both open and concealed carry without a license. However, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation issues Self-Defense Act Licenses (SDAL) to residents and eligible military personnel stationed in Oklahoma. Applicants must be 21 or older, complete a firearms course, and meet other criteria. Non-residents are not eligible for these licenses. Oklahoma recognizes permits issued by all other states and allows residents of other permitless carry states to carry within its borders.

### Immunity and Self-Defense

Under Oklahoma law, individuals using justified defensive force are immune from both criminal prosecution and civil liability. Oklahoma upholds the Castle Doctrine and “stand your ground” principles, meaning there is no obligation to retreat in any place where one has a legal right to be. Individuals have the right to defend themselves with force, including deadly force, if they believe it is necessary to prevent death, great bodily harm, or the commission of a forcible felony.

For specific definitions and further details, refer to Oklahoma state statutes.

### Summary of Georgia Gun Laws

Georgia is a shall-issue state with concealed weapons licenses issued at the county level and filed with the probate court in the county of residence. There is no license, background check, or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in Georgia only with a Georgia Weapons Carry License (WCL) or a concealed carry permit from a state Georgia honors. Some areas are off-limits, including schools and courthouses. Open carry is not addressed in the constitutional carry bill that was signed into law on April 12, 2022.

There is no firearms training required to obtain a Georgia WCL. You must be at least 21 years old (18 for members of the military) to get a concealed carry license in Georgia. No license is needed to carry a handgun in a person’s home, vehicle, place of business, while fishing or hunting, or unloaded in a case.

### Defense of Habitation

A person is justified in threatening or using force when and to the extent that he or she reasonably believes that such threat or force is necessary to prevent or terminate another’s unlawful entry into or attack upon a habitation. Deadly force is justified only if:

  * The force is used against another person who is not a member of the family or household and who unlawfully and forcibly enters or has entered the residence.
  * The person using such force reasonably believes that the entry is made or attempted for the purpose of committing a felony.



### Defense of Property Other Than Habitation

A person is justified in threatening or using force to the extent that he reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent or terminate trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with real property other than a habitation or personal property:

  * Lawfully in his possession or in the possession of a member of his immediate family.
  * Belonging to a person whose property he has a legal duty to protect.



The use of deadly force intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to prevent trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with real property other than a habitation or personal property is justified only if it is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

### STORE IN A VEHICLE IN AN EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT?

Does Georgia have laws relating to storing firearms in private vehicles in an employee parking lot?

No private or public employer, including the state and its political subdivisions, can condition employment upon any agreement by a prospective employee on prohibiting firearms or ammunition in the employees privately owned motor vehicle, provided any firearm or ammunition is locked and out of sight and the employee has a Georgia weapons carry license. This provision does not apply to an employer providing a secure parking area not accessible to the general public or to an area used for parking on a temporary basis, among other exceptions. In addition, this provision does not restrict the rights of private property owners or persons in legal control of property, and when a private property owner or person in legal control of property is also an employer, his or her rights as a private property owner or person in legal control of property govern. State law allows a license holder to possess a firearm in a motor vehicle parked in a parking facility of a government entity, courthouse, jail, prison, place of worship, bar or school safety zone, so long as the firearm is in the locked compartment of the vehicle, or in a locked container in or a locked firearms rack on the vehicle.

#### An overview of the gun laws of Arkansas

Arkansas is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Concealed weapons licenses are issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety.

No license, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

Permitless open carry is legal without a license for any person who is at least 18 years old and can legally possess a firearm. On October 17, 2018, the Arkansas Appeals Court ruled in case CR-18–353 Jamie Taff v. State of Arkansas that the possessor of a handgun must have an unlawful intent to use it as a weapon against a person for possession to be a criminal act. Some areas, including schools and bars, are off-limits.

Concealed carry is legal without a license for anyone over 18 who can legally possess a firearm and is on a journey (outside of their home or property). Concealed Handgun Carry Licenses (CHCL) are issued to residents at least 21 years old or 18 if a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or National Guard, requiring a state-approved firearms training course. Arkansas offers two types of handgun carry licenses: the CHCL and an Enhanced Concealed Carry License (E-CHCL), which allows carrying in some restricted areas such as public colleges, most public buildings, non-secure locations in airports, and churches. The E-CHCL requires about 8 hours of additional classroom and gun-range training. Arkansas does not issue non-resident licenses, but active-duty military and their spouses may apply for an Arkansas CHCL. With permitless carry, anyone who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

#### Use of Physical Force

A person is justified in using physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or a third person from the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force.

#### Use of Deadly Physical Force in Defense of a Person

A person is justified in using deadly physical force if they reasonably believe the other person is:

  * Committing or about to commit a felony involving physical force or violence
  * Using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force
  * Engaged in a pattern of domestic abuse



A person is not required to retreat before using deadly physical force if they:

  * Are lawfully present at the location where deadly physical force is used
  * Have a reasonable belief that the person against whom deadly physical force is used is imminently threatening to cause death or serious physical injury to themselves or another person
  * Are not the initial aggressor and have not provoked the person against whom deadly physical force is used
  * Are not engaged in criminal activity



#### Defense of Premises

A person in lawful possession or control of premises or a vehicle is justified in using non-deadly physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass.

A person may use deadly physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent the commission of arson or burglary by a trespasser.

#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property

A person is justified in using non-deadly physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of theft or criminal mischief or the subsequent flight from the commission or attempted commission of theft or criminal mischief.

#### Self-Defense

The Castle Doctrine in Arkansas states that the right of an individual to defend themselves and their home against harm, injury, or loss by a person unlawfully entering or attempting to enter the home is a fundamental right. As of March 3, 2021, Arkansas has a “stand your ground” law, with no duty to retreat before force can be used for self-defense anywhere a person is lawfully allowed to be.

Massachusetts became a shall-issue state following the Supreme Court’s ruling on the NYSRPA v Bruen case on June 23rd, 2022. Licenses to Carry (LTC) are issued at the local police station or, for non-residents, through the State Police Firearms Records Bureau.

A Firearm Identification (FID) card or LTC is required to purchase a firearm. Background checks are mandatory for buying a handgun from a private individual, as the seller must verify the buyer’s Firearm Identification Card with the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services. An LTC is also required to purchase ammunition. Although handguns do not need to be registered, all firearm sales and transfers must be reported to the Department of Criminal Justice Information Services, which maintains comprehensive records of these transactions.

The former Class B license allowed for the open carry of non-large capacity firearms. Although some Class B licenses may still be valid, no new Class B licenses are being issued due to revisions in licensure.

Concealed carry is legal in Massachusetts for individuals who have a Massachusetts LTC or a formerly issued, valid Class A LTC. The minimum age to obtain an LTC is 21 years old. LTCs are issued to both residents and non-residents and require a state-approved firearms training course. Some areas, such as schools and airports, are off-limits for carrying firearms. Massachusetts does not honor permits from any other states.

### Self-Defense

Massachusetts follows the Castle Doctrine. According to Massachusetts law, if a person who is an occupant of a dwelling is charged with killing or injuring someone who was unlawfully in the dwelling, it is a defense that the occupant was in the dwelling at the time of the offense and acted under the reasonable belief that the intruder was about to inflict great bodily injury or death. The occupant must have used reasonable means to defend themselves or another person lawfully in the dwelling. There is no duty to retreat within one’s own dwelling, but there is a duty to retreat outside of one’s home.

A “dwelling” is defined as a building that serves as a permanent or temporary residence, which excludes tents, motor homes, and boats. Common areas of buildings, such as hallways, do not fall under the Castle Doctrine.

### Summary of Michigan Gun Laws

Michigan operates as a shall-issue state, with licenses distributed at the local level by county clerks. To purchase a handgun, residents need a Michigan license or a background check. Non-residents are allowed to buy long guns but not handguns. While there is no firearm registry, all handgun sales require a pistol sales record form to be filed with the Michigan State Police.

### Open Carry in Michigan

Open carry is legal for Michigan residents who are at least 18 years old and can legally possess a firearm, provided the gun is registered in their name. Non-residents must possess a valid concealed carry license from their home state to open or conceal carry in Michigan. Open carry is permitted in more locations than concealed carry, as the restrictions listed in Mich. Comp. Laws § 28.425o apply only to concealed carry.

### Concealed Carry in Michigan

Concealed carry is legal for Michigan residents with a Michigan Concealed Pistol License (CPL) and for non-residents who are at least 21 years old and have licenses or permits from their home state. CPLs are issued exclusively to residents, with exceptions for active duty military personnel stationed in Michigan or whose home of record is Michigan. Michigan Complied Laws Section 28.432a lists individuals exempt from requiring a CPL, including certain peace officers and military members in the line of duty. Obtaining a CPL necessitates completing a state-approved firearms training course with a minimum of eight hours of instruction, including three hours of range time. Certain areas, such as schools and hospitals, are off-limits to concealed carry. Michigan recognizes resident licenses from all states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

### Self-Defense Laws in Michigan

### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Michigan adheres to the Castle Doctrine and has a “stand your ground” law. This allows individuals to use deadly force without a duty to retreat, anywhere they have the legal right to be. Those who use a gun legitimately in self-defense are granted immunity from civil liability.

### Use of Non-Deadly Force

An individual not involved in a crime may use non-deadly force against another person anywhere they have the legal right to be, without a duty to retreat. This is permissible if the individual believes, honestly and reasonably, that such force is necessary to defend themselves or another person from imminent unlawful force.

### Use of Deadly Force

An individual not involved in a crime may use deadly force against another person anywhere they have the legal right to be, without a duty to retreat. This is permissible if the individual believes, honestly and reasonably, that such force is necessary to prevent:

  * Imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another person; or
  * Imminent sexual assault of themselves or another person.

### Handgun Purchase & Possession

### Can I possess a handgun on my private property without a license?

### Are background checks required for private gun sales in Michigan?

No.

### Is there a waiting period after purchasing a handgun in Michigan?

No. Michigan has no waiting period for the purchase of a handgun.

### What is the minimum age to possess and transport a handgun in Michigan?

18 years old. Generally, an individual less than 18 years of age shall not possess a firearm in public except under the direct supervision of an individual 18 years of age or older, although there are exceptions for hunting and target shooting ranges.

### Do handguns need to be registered in Michigan?

Although there is no firearm registry, all handgun sales require a Pistol Sales Record (RI-60) form to be filed with the Michigan State Police. There are several exceptions, including but not limited to police officers.

### Is a permit required to purchase a handgun in Michigan?

Only Michigan residents may purchase pistols in Michigan. A National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background check is performed on all commercial firearm sales at the time of purchase. The Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) may elect to use a valid Michigan License to Purchase a Pistol (received from your local police department) in lieu of a NICS background check. The buyer must be at least 21 years of age, a resident of Michigan, possess a clean criminal background, and be mentally stable.

### Handgun Purchase Process

  * Only a Michigan resident may purchase a handgun in Michigan.
  * A NICS background check is performed on all commercial firearm sales at the time of purchase. The FFL may elect to use a valid Michigan License to Purchase a Pistol (LTP) or have the purchaser complete a Federal Form 4473 for a NICS background check.
  * To purchase a pistol in a private transaction, the buyer must have a Michigan CPL or LTP.



**License to Purchase a Pistol (RI-10 Form):**

  * A License to Purchase a Pistol can only be obtained from your local police or sheriff’s office. You will need a valid Michigan driver’s license or Michigan state ID with your current address listed to get your license. Generally, the background check that is conducted to get an LTP will take between 24 and 48 hours, and you will be allowed to pick up your license after that criminal and mental health record background check has been completed.
  * An LTP must be used within 30 days of the date it is issued or it will be void. One copy of your RI-10 will be kept on record by the seller, one by the purchaser, and the third must be filed with the Michigan State Police through your local police department within 10 days of your purchase.

> Legal information provided is for reference and not legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific legal concerns.

### Summary of Illinois Gun Laws

Illinois is a shall-issue state, meaning the Illinois State Police must issue a concealed carry license if the applicant meets certain qualifications. However, law enforcement can object to an applicant if they believe the applicant is a danger to public safety or themselves. Such cases are reviewed by the Concealed Carry Licensing Review Board, which makes the final decision. Applicants are notified by mail, and there is an appeal process.

Open carry of a handgun on your person or in a vehicle is illegal.

An Illinois Concealed Carry License (CCL) is required to carry a concealed firearm in Illinois. Applicants must be 21 or older and complete a 16-hour firearms training course conducted by a state-approved instructor. The license permits carrying a loaded or unloaded handgun concealed from public view or within a vehicle. Non-resident licenses are only available for residents of Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas, and Virginia. Illinois does not honor concealed carry licenses from any other state.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

Illinois residents must have a Firearm Owners Identification Card (FOID) to possess a firearm or ammunition. FOID card holders without a CCL can carry unloaded firearms enclosed in a case. You must be 21 years old to apply for a FOID card, or have a parent or guardian sponsor who is eligible for a FOID card.

### COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustments

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, FOID card holders and CCL licensees who submit renewal applications will remain valid during the state’s disaster proclamation and for 18 months following its termination. This applies even if their renewal application was not submitted before expiration. A FOID card or CCL that expired during the pandemic is still considered valid if the holder applied for renewal, paid the required fees, and the card is not subject to revocation. Additionally, CCL licensees do not need to immediately submit proof of three-hour training with their renewal application but must submit proof within 18 months following the end of the disaster proclamation.

### Self-Defense

Illinois is a Castle Doctrine state. There is no legal duty to retreat if threatened, and using deadly force is justified.

### Use of Force in Defense of Person

A person is justified in using force when they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or another against imminent unlawful force. Deadly force is justified only if it is necessary to prevent imminent death, great bodily harm, or the commission of a forcible felony.

### Use of Force in Defense of Other Property

A person can use force to prevent or terminate another’s trespass or criminal interference with real or personal property. Deadly force is justified only to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

### Liability

Acts involving justified use of force do not give rise to liability unless the force used involves willful or wanton misconduct.

### Use of Force in Defense of Dwelling

A person can use force to prevent or terminate an unlawful entry or attack on a dwelling. Deadly force is justified if:

  * The entry is violent, and the person believes it necessary to prevent an assault or offer of personal violence.
  * The person believes it necessary to prevent the commission of a felony in the dwelling.



### Assault Weapons Ban

On January 10, 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker signed HB 5471, the Protect Illinois Communities Act, into law. This law makes it illegal to deliver, sell, purchase, or possess assault weapons, assault weapon attachments, .50 caliber rifles, or .50 caliber cartridges. Possession of such weapons is illegal 300 days after the law’s effective date, except for weapons registered with the Illinois State Police within the specified time.

### Assault Weapon Definition

### Illinois Gun Laws at a Glance

### Carry Basics

### Weapons Other Than Handguns Allowed?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry weapons other than handguns in Illinois with a concealed carry license (or under permitless carry if applicable)?  
**Answer:** No. An Illinois concealed carry license does not cover weapons other than handguns.

### Tasers or Stun Guns?

**Question:** Is it legal to own a taser or stun gun in Illinois?  
**Answer:** Yes. Tasers are legal to purchase with a valid FOID or an Illinois concealed carry license. Based on the passage of HB 562, beginning on January 1, 2024, the buyer must keep a record of the transfer for a period of 10 years and provide a record of the transfer within 10 days to a federally licensed firearm dealer (FFL). The FFL must maintain the transfer record for 20 years from the date of receipt. An FFL may charge a fee not to exceed $25 to retain the record.

The Illinois Supreme Court ruled on March 21, 2019, that the comprehensive ban on carrying stun guns and Tasers in public was unconstitutional. However, it’s still illegal to carry stun guns and Tasers in certain circumstances and places, including:

  * When intended to use unlawfully against someone
  * While masked or hooded to hide identity
  * In places licensed to sell intoxicating beverages
  * At any licensed public gathering where admission is charged

The sale or possession of stun guns and Tasers is illegal in Chicago.

**Answer:** No. Open carry is not permitted in Illinois.

**Answer:** You must be at least 21 years old to carry concealed in Illinois.

### Chemical Spray/Pepper Spray?

### Ammunition Restrictions?

**Question:** Does Illinois have ammunition restrictions?  
**Answer:** Yes. Armor-piercing ammunition is prohibited. Residents must obtain a Firearm Owner’s Identification (FOID) card to buy ammunition. Even if buying ammo outside the state, residents need a FOID card and a driver’s license or state-issued identification card to take shipment of ammunition.

Note: Most Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) handgun ammunition commonly used for training is exempt based on jacket weight or core composition. Read the label for details.

### Carry Locations

### Carry in State/National Parks, State/National Forests, and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs)

Yes, anyone with an Illinois CCL may keep or carry a loaded or unloaded concealed firearm in a vehicle. Non-residents may transport a loaded concealed handgun if they have a valid CCW permit from their home state. Non-residents from states allowing concealed/open carry without a license are not required to produce a license if they are not prohibited under federal law and are eligible to carry in their home state.

If non-residents leave their vehicles unattended, the firearm must be stored within a locked vehicle or locked container out of plain view. The firearm may only be carried in the immediate area surrounding the vehicle for the purpose of storing or retrieving it within the trunk.

### Non-Resident Permitting

**Does Illinois issue concealed carry licenses to non-residents?**

Currently, the only states considered to be substantially similar are Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas, and Virginia.

### Public Access to Concealed Carry Registry

### Preemption

**Does Illinois have preemption laws related to concealed carry?**

Yes, the state has preemption of firearms laws in Illinois. The regulation, licensing, possession, registration, and transportation of handguns and ammunition for handguns by concealed handgun licensees are exclusive powers and functions of the State. Any ordinance or regulation that purports to impose regulations or restrictions on licensees or handguns and ammunition for handguns shall be invalid in its application to licensees. Local municipalities can regulate individuals who do not possess a valid FOID card or CCL, firearms other than handguns, and matters related to the sale, purchase, and storage of all firearms.

### Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs

### “No Weapons Allowed” Signs Enforced

**Are “No Weapons Allowed” signs enforced in Illinois?**

Yes. Signs stating that the carrying of firearms is prohibited must be clearly and conspicuously posted at the entrance of a building, premises, or real property specified as a prohibited area unless the building or premises is a private residence.

_Consult with an attorney if you have any questions about your eligibility. If you don’t have an attorney, you can find one by contacting the State Bar of Illinois._

Based on the passage of HB 562 (2021), the following process will be implemented as of January 1, 2022:

  * The Illinois State Police will create a combined FOID and CCL, offering cardholders the ability to apply for renewal 6 months before the expiration date, and will update FOID and CCL renewal dates to be the same for one cardholder.
  * Beginning January 1, 2022, if the FOID expires during the term of the licensee’s CCL, the FOID and the license remain valid during the validity of the CCL. The licensee does not have to renew his or her FOID if it has not been otherwise renewed as provided in this Act. Unless the Illinois State Police has reason to believe the licensee is no longer eligible for the card, the Illinois State Police may automatically renew the licensee’s FOID.



### Fees:

  * Initial License: $150 ($300 for non-residents)
  * Renewals: $150 ($300 for non-residents)



### Valid For:

### Processing Time:

90–120 days

### Non-Resident Concealed Carry Licenses:

Illinois grants non-resident licenses only to residents of states or territories of the United States that have laws related to firearm ownership, possession, and carrying that are substantially similar to the requirements in Illinois. Currently, the only states considered to be substantially similar are Arkansas, Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas, and Virginia. The application process is the same as for residents.

### Name/Address Changes:

Notify the Department within 30 days of moving or changing residence or any change of name and submit the appropriate fee. The Department may require a notarized statement that you have changed your residence or name, including the prior and current address or name and the date you moved or changed your name.

### Residency Changes:

### Moving to Illinois and Interested in Applying for a Resident License?

Illinois issues licenses to residents and select non-residents. Residents are required to obtain a Firearm Owner’s Identification (FOID) card to apply for a license. Non-residents are not required to have a FOID provided they have a valid concealed carry permit issued in their home state. Any new resident who is not otherwise prohibited from possessing or using a firearm is not required to have a FOID card to possess firearms or firearms ammunition until 60 calendar days after he or she obtains an Illinois driver’s license or Illinois ID Card.

### Moving from Illinois and Have an Illinois Resident License?

Does that license transfer to your new state?

Is there a grace period during which your Illinois license remains valid? Simply mail your FOID and CCL back to the Firearms Services Bureau at 801 S. 7th Street, Suite 400M, Springfield, Illinois 62703. Include a note that you have moved out of state and are surrendering your FOID/CCL.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

  * **Concealed Carry Laws:**
  * Residents with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License (CWL) and non-residents with valid licenses/permits from states recognized by Wisconsin can carry concealed.
  * CWLs are issued to residents and military personnel stationed in Wisconsin, requiring applicants to be 21 or older and to complete a firearms training course.
  * **Reciprocity:**
  * Wisconsin honors permits from states with reciprocity agreements and those requiring background checks comparable to Wisconsin’s standards.



### Defense of Property and Self-Defense Laws

  * **Defense of Property:**
  * Individuals may use force to prevent unlawful interference with their property, limited to what is reasonably necessary to stop or prevent the interference.
  * Deadly force solely for defense of property is not considered reasonable.
  * **Self-Defense Laws:**
  * Wisconsin follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to defend their residence, vehicle, or business without a duty to retreat.
  * Deadly force can only be used if there is a reasonable belief that it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.
  * **Defense of Others:**
  * Individuals can intervene to defend others from unlawful interference under the same conditions as self-defense, assuming the third person would have the right to self-defense.
  * The use of deadly force to protect others is justified when reasonably believed necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.
  * **Presumption in Deadly Force Cases:**
  * If deadly force is used against an intruder in a dwelling, vehicle, or place of business, it is presumed that the force was necessary if certain conditions are met.



These laws are outlined under Wis. Stat. §§ 939.48 & 939.49, defining the parameters of self-defense and property protection in Wisconsin.

**CARRY IN VEHICLE?**

Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in Wisconsin? Yes, with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, but not in or on the grounds of a school. The Wisconsin Supreme Court on 4/10/18 ruled that a person must have a license that is valid in Wisconsin to carry a concealed loaded handgun within reach in a vehicle. Without a license, a loaded handgun must not be concealed in any manner, including on a car seat. Based on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruling in State v. Walls (1994), in order to be considered openly carried in a vehicle, the handgun must be discernible from the ordinary observation of a person located outside and within the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. Some interpret this to mean above the window line of the vehicle.

[Statute Reference: Wis. Stat. § 175.60(2g)©]

### DRIVER’S LICENSE LINKED TO Carry License?

Is my Wisconsin driver’s license linked to my Wisconsin carry license?

### FAQ: Wisconsin Concealed Carry Questions

### Carry While Gun Hunting?

Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in Wisconsin?

  * Yes, with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, except when shining. Additionally, individuals who own, lease, or legally occupy land and are at least 18 years old may possess a concealed handgun while hunting on those lands without needing a concealed carry license. The handgun must be legal size and caliber for the species being hunted.



### Carry While Bow Hunting?

Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in Wisconsin?

  * Yes. Individuals with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, or qualified former law enforcement officers, may possess the type of firearm they qualified with in a wildlife refuge, Wisconsin state park, or state fish hatchery. However, this does not permit hunting or discharging firearms in these areas, nor does it allow firearms inside state-owned buildings on these properties if posted with signs prohibiting firearms. Individuals who own, lease, or legally occupy land and are at least 18 years old may also possess a concealed handgun while hunting on those lands without needing a concealed carry license.



### Hunter Harassment Law?

Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in Wisconsin?

  * Yes. No person may interfere or attempt to interfere with lawful hunting, fishing, or trapping with the intent to prevent the taking of a wild animal, or intentionally interfere with an activity associated with lawful hunting, fishing, or trapping. [Wis. Stat. § 29.083]



### What are the Knife Laws in Wisconsin?

Knives are not listed as dangerous weapons in Wisconsin, so knives may be carried openly or concealed. Anyone prohibited from possessing a firearm is also prohibited from carrying a concealed knife. Knives are prohibited at K-12 schools and may be restricted at government facilities by local ordinances. [Wis. Stat. §§ 939.22(10), 941.231, 948.61]

### Wear a COVID Mask & Carry?

I can legally carry a concealed firearm in Wisconsin, but can I wear a COVID-19 protective mask while carrying concealed?

  * One statute in Wisconsin concerns individuals concealing their identity with intent to commit illegal acts or to hide their identity, but it does not specifically address wearing a mask while legally carrying a concealed firearm. There are no statutory or regulatory prohibitions identified that affect carrying a concealed carry license while complying with the order to wear a mask. [Wis. Stat. § 939.41]

### Summary of Colorado Gun Laws

### Concealed Carry Permits

Colorado is a shall-issue state where concealed carry permits are issued by local sheriff’s offices to county residents. There are no purchase permits or firearms registration requirements for handguns. Non-residents can obtain a concealed carry permit if they hold a valid permit from a state recognized by Colorado. Applicants must be at least 21 years old and not prohibited by law from possessing a firearm. A state-approved firearms training course is mandatory for obtaining a concealed carry permit.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Colorado for individuals aged 18 or older who can legally possess a firearm, except in Denver County and other areas where signage prohibits it. Local governments have the authority to regulate open carrying within their jurisdiction, provided appropriate signage is displayed.

### Self-Defense Laws

Colorado follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to expect absolute safety within their homes. There is no duty to retreat, and this principle applies within one’s residence or any other occupied dwelling. While Colorado does not explicitly have a stand your ground law, the Colorado Supreme Court has clarified that individuals acting in self-defense are not required to retreat and can stand their ground.

### Use of Force in Defense

  * **Defense of Property:** Individuals may use reasonable force to prevent theft, criminal mischief, or tampering involving property. Deadly force is permissible in defense of oneself or others.
  * **Defense of Person:** Reasonable force can be used to defend against unlawful physical force. Individuals are justified in using the necessary degree of force to protect themselves or others.
  * **Defense Against an Intruder:** Any occupant of a dwelling can use any level of force, including deadly force, if they reasonably believe an intruder has unlawfully entered and is committing a crime or poses a threat of physical force.
  * **Defense of Premises:** Property owners or those in control of premises can use reasonable force to prevent unlawful trespassing. Deadly force is only justified to prevent a trespasser from committing first-degree arson.

### Civil and Criminal Immunity

Individuals who use justified physical force, including deadly force, in accordance with Colorado law are immune from criminal prosecution and civil liability for injuries or deaths resulting from such actions.

[Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18–1–704, 18–1–704.5, 18–1–705 & 18–1–706]

### Self-Defense Laws in Colorado

Colorado adheres to the Castle Doctrine, providing its residents with the right to anticipate absolute safety within their residences. There is no obligation to retreat under Colorado law, which extends to both one’s home and any other inhabited structure. While Colorado does not explicitly enforce a stand your ground law, the Colorado Supreme Court has upheld that individuals acting in self-defense are not required to retreat and are permitted to stand their ground, especially when they are not the aggressors in the situation.

### Summary of New Mexico Gun Laws

New Mexico operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons licenses issued by the Department of Public Safety. Residents must obtain a New Mexico Concealed Handgun License (CHL), while non-residents can carry with a permit from a state that New Mexico honors.

### Firearm Sales and Background Checks

As of July 1, 2019, background checks are mandatory for private firearm sales in New Mexico under SB-8. Exceptions include sales between law enforcement officers and immediate family members. Selling a gun without a background check is now a misdemeanor offense.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in New Mexico for individuals aged 19 and older who can legally possess a firearm. Some restrictions apply, such as on tribal lands and at establishments selling hard liquor.

### Concealed Carry Requirements

To carry a concealed loaded firearm on foot, residents must hold a New Mexico CHL, which specifies the category and caliber of handgun allowed. The minimum age for obtaining a CHL is 21, and applicants must complete a 15-hour handgun safety course that includes live-fire instruction.

### Reciprocity and Other Provisions

New Mexico recognizes concealed carry permits from states with reciprocity agreements. Non-resident licenses are generally not issued, except for military personnel permanently stationed in New Mexico and their dependents.

### Self-Defense Laws

While New Mexico does not have a specific Castle Doctrine statute, State v. Couch (1946) established that individuals threatened with an attack have the right to stand their ground and defend themselves. Homicide is justifiable under New Mexico law in cases of necessary defense of life, family, or property, lawful defense against imminent danger, or during lawful attempts to apprehend a felon or suppress a riot. Defendants using self-defense must demonstrate reasonable fear of immediate harm, use of appropriate force to counter the threat, and lack of provocation.

These laws outline the framework for firearm ownership, carrying, and self-defense rights in New Mexico.

### Firearms Training Requirements in New Mexico

### New Mexico Concealed Handgun License Training Requirements

New Mexico mandates that applicants for concealed handgun licenses must satisfactorily complete an approved firearms training course tailored to the category and largest caliber of handgun they intend to carry. However, military service personnel discharged within 20 years of applying for a license or renewal are exempt from this requirement, including the need for a refresher firearms training course.

The New Mexico Department of Public Safety (DPS) establishes and publishes minimum standards for approved training courses. These courses must encompass classroom instruction, range practice, and a practical demonstration by the applicant using at least a .32 caliber handgun. Key elements of the training include:

  * Safe handling and proficiency with single- and double-action revolvers and semi-automatic handguns
  * Secure storage practices and child safety measures
  * Fundamentals of safe handgun shooting
  * Live shooting on a designated firing range
  * Techniques for maintaining and enhancing handgun skills
  * Knowledge of federal, state, and local laws governing handgun purchase, ownership, transportation, use, and possession
  * Strategies for preventing criminal attacks and managing violent encounters
  * Methods for non-violent conflict resolution



Approved training courses are those endorsed or sponsored by federal or state law enforcement agencies, educational institutions, firearms training schools, or nationally recognized organizations sanctioned by the DPS for providing firearms training. Each instructor of an approved course must annually submit a course description and certification proof to the DPS.

### Refresher Training Requirements

Licensees must undergo refresher training at regular intervals:

  * A 2-hour refresher firearms training course is mandatory two years after receiving an original or renewed license. This course must be approved by the department and completed between 22 to 26 months after the license issuance. A certificate of completion must be submitted to the department within 30 days of finishing the course.
  * For license renewals, a 4-hour refresher firearms training course approved by the department is required.



These training requirements ensure that license holders maintain proficiency and stay informed about laws and techniques essential for responsible handgun use and safety.

### Permit to Acquire Application Process

In order to purchase a handgun in Iowa, whether through a licensed firearms dealer or a private transaction (unless between family members), either a Permit to Acquire a pistol or revolver or a Permit to Carry Weapons is required.

Some counties accept online applications, others accept them by mail, but most require an application to be submitted at the county sheriff’s office in person. To see if your county of residence accepts online permits, check the county sheriff’s office website directly.

In order to obtain a Permit to Acquire, you will need a valid driver’s license or state-issued ID and will have to pay a fee. A National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) background check will be processed. The processing time to obtain a Permit to Acquire will differ county by county and may take up to 10 days. The permit itself is not valid until 3 days after the date it is issued.

### Summary of Pennsylvania Gun Laws

Pennsylvania operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons licenses, issued at the county level by the sheriff’s office or, for residents of cities of the first class, by the chief of police.

### Firearm Purchase and Registration

No permit is required for purchasing firearms in Pennsylvania, and there is no comprehensive firearms registration system. However, the state police maintain a database of all handgun buyers. Private-party transfers of handguns must be conducted through a licensed dealer or at a county sheriff’s office, with a mandatory background check. Exceptions include transfers between spouses, parents and children, or grandparents and grandchildren.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Pennsylvania for individuals 18 or older who are legally allowed to possess a firearm. A significant court decision (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Darren Montgomery, 234 A.3d 523 (PA 2020)) has created ambiguity regarding the definition of open carry. To open or conceal carry in a vehicle or to open carry in Philadelphia, individuals need a Pennsylvania License to Carry Firearms (LCF) or a permit from a reciprocal state.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry is lawful for residents with an LCF and for non-residents with a license/permit recognized by Pennsylvania. The state issues LCFs to residents and non-residents aged 21 and older (a recent court ruling found restrictions on 18–20 year olds unconstitutional). Non-residents must possess a valid carry permit from their home state. Pennsylvania does not mandate training for obtaining an LCF and only honors resident CCW licenses from states with reciprocity agreements.

### Self-Defense Laws

Pennsylvania adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and has a “stand your ground” law, permitting individuals to use force in self-defense without a duty to retreat in their residence or any place they legally occupy. Use of force is justified when protecting against unlawful force, including scenarios involving deadly weapons. Deadly force is justifiable to prevent death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, or sexual assault, under specific conditions outlined in state statutes.

### Use of Force for Property Protection

The use of force is justified to prevent unlawful entry or trespass on land or to reclaim movable property. Pennsylvania law permits defensive actions when an actor believes such force is immediately necessary.

[18 Pa. Cons. Stat, §§ 505, 506 & 507]

**Tasers or Stun Guns?**

[18 Pa. Cons. Stat, § 908.1]

**Open Carry Permitted?**

Is open carry permitted in Pennsylvania? Yes, without a license. Any person who is at least 18 years old and legally entitled to possess a firearm can open carry. A license is required in a vehicle and in the city of Philadelphia. Be aware that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Darren Montgomery, 234 A.3d 523 (PA 2020), holding that sometimes a visible firearm is a concealed firearm. This decision has created uncertainty about the definition of open carry.

[18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5503]



**Carry While Using Alcohol or Drugs?**

  * Does Pennsylvania have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or drugs? Not addressed in state statutes. As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgement, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.



**Non-Resident Permitting?**

This has been reinforced by the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas decision against the City of Pittsburgh in Anderson v. City of Pittsburgh. The court found that Pittsburgh’s attempt to impose local gun control measures was a clear violation of state preemption law. [18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 6120]

### Summary of Alabama Gun Laws

Alabama generally operates as a shall-issue state with concealed weapons permits distributed at the county level by local sheriffs. However, a sheriff can deny a permit if the applicant is legally barred from owning a firearm under state or federal law or if there is a reasonable suspicion of potential misuse of the weapon.

Private handgun sales do not require a permit, background check, or registration. Open carry is permitted without a permit for those aged 19 or older who can legally possess a firearm, with certain locations like schools and courthouses being off-limits.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Constitutional Carry

As of January 1, 2023, per HB 272, law-abiding residents and citizens aged 19 or older can carry a concealed pistol without a permit. The law does not specify a minimum age for carry. Under Alabama Code Section 13A-11–72, minors cannot possess firearms unless under adult supervision in specific scenarios.

### Concealed Carry

Residents with an Alabama Pistol Permit and non-residents with a recognized permit can carry concealed firearms. No firearms safety course is required for permit issuance. Sheriffs may issue permits to active-duty military personnel stationed in Alabama and their spouses. Military veterans can obtain or renew permits free of charge. Alabama honors all out-of-state concealed carry permits.

### Self-Defense

Alabama follows the Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground principles, allowing individuals to use force, including deadly force, without a duty to retreat if they are legally present and not engaged in unlawful activity.

### Civil and Criminal Immunity

Force used in self-defense, as justified under Alabama law, grants immunity from criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits unless deemed unlawful.

### Use of Force in Defense

Individuals can use physical force to defend themselves or others against unlawful force and can use deadly force in circumstances such as preventing unlawful deadly force, burglary, forcible entry, or imminent crimes like rape or robbery.

### Defense of Premises and Property

Lawful occupants can use force to prevent or terminate criminal trespass and may use deadly force to prevent arson on the premises. Non-deadly force is permissible to protect property other than premises.

### Summary of Missouri Gun Laws

Missouri operates as a permitless carry state and a shall-issue state. Permits are issued at the county level for reciprocity purposes by sheriffs.

There is no requirement for a permit, background check, or firearms registration when purchasing a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal for individuals 19 years or older who can legally possess a firearm (18 for military members or honorably discharged). Local authorities may restrict concealed carry in buildings they own, lease, or control, and may require a Concealed Carry Permit (CCP) for open carry. The law in Missouri does not explicitly state that a permit is unnecessary for carry; instead, the definition of “unlawful use of a weapon” specifies carrying in off-limits areas.

### Obtaining a Missouri Concealed Carry Permit (CCP)

To obtain a Missouri CCP, applicants must be at least 19 years old (18 for military members or honorably discharged) and have completed a firearms training course. Applications must be submitted in the applicant’s county of residence. Non-resident permits are available to active duty military personnel or veterans aged 18 or older stationed in Missouri. Restricted locations include courthouses, public passenger buses, and trains.

### Self-Defense Laws in Missouri

Missouri follows Castle Doctrine principles and has a “stand your ground” law. This law allows individuals to defend themselves outside their homes without retreating. Deadly force is justifiable if a person reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death, serious physical injury, or a forcible felony. Physical force is justifiable to defend against unlawful force or to prevent theft, damage, or tampering with property.

In 2016, the Missouri Court of Appeals clarified that deadly force under the Castle Doctrine can only be used to protect against the use or imminent use of unlawful force, not solely to protect property.

Missouri law prohibits political subdivisions from restricting the use of firearms to defend people or property.

### Summary of Utah Gun Laws

### General Regulations

Utah is a shall-issue state, meaning that permits for carrying concealed firearms are issued by the Bureau of Criminal Identification. When buying a handgun from a private individual, no permit, background check, or firearms registration is required. Although the state has preemption, Salt Lake County has established a policy requiring background checks for private sales at the county’s three event facilities: Salt Palace Convention Center, Mountain America Expo Center, and Salt Lake County Equestrian Park.

### Recent Legislative Changes

On March 24, 2022, Governor Spencer Cox signed SB 115 into law, giving the state greater control over gun laws in Utah. This law allows the state to override policies established by local authorities, such as the policy set by Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson in 2019. The law took effect on July 1, 2022.

### Carrying Firearms

As of May 5, 2021, following the signing of HB 60 by Governor Cox, both open carry and concealed carry of a loaded firearm are legal for individuals at least 21 years old who can lawfully possess a firearm. Utah Concealed Firearm Permits (CFPs) are still available for those seeking reciprocity to carry in other states. Utah CFPs can be issued to residents aged 21 or older, or 18 for a provisional permit. Non-residents aged 21 or older who have a permit from their home state may also apply. Certain areas, including courthouses and secured areas of airports, are off-limits for carrying firearms. Obtaining a concealed carry permit requires completing a firearms familiarity course certified by the Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI). Since Utah has permitless carry, anyone aged 21 and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

### Self-Defense Laws

#### Castle Doctrine and Stand Your Ground

Utah is a Castle Doctrine state, also known as a state with a “defense of habitation” law, and has a “stand your ground” law. This means there is no duty to retreat if a person believes deadly force is necessary to prevent a felony in any place where they have a legal right to be.

#### Force in Defense of Person

An individual is justified in threatening or using force when they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or another person against the imminent use of unlawful force. Deadly force is justified only if the individual believes it is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to themselves or another person, or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

#### Force in Defense of Property

A person is justified in using non-deadly force to prevent or terminate another person’s criminal interference with real or personal property that is:

  * Lawfully in the person’s possession,
  * Lawfully in the possession of a member of the person’s immediate family, or
  * Belonging to someone whose property the person has a legal duty to protect.



#### Civil and Criminal Immunity

Individuals using deadly force in defense of personal or real property are presumed to have acted reasonably and with a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the trespass or attempted trespass is unlawful and is made or attempted with force, or in a violent and tumultuous manner, or for the purpose of committing a forcible felony.

#### Force in Defense of Habitation

A person is justified in using force to prevent or terminate another’s unlawful entry into or attack upon their habitation. Deadly force is justified if:

  * The entry is made or attempted in a violent and tumultuous manner, surreptitiously, or by stealth, and the person reasonably believes the entry is for the purpose of assaulting or offering personal violence to anyone in the habitation.
  * The person reasonably believes the entry is for the purpose of committing a felony in the habitation and that force is necessary to prevent the felony.



#### Deadly Force in Defense of Persons on Real Property

Deadly force is justified in defense of persons on real property if:

  * The person is in lawful possession of the property,
  * The person reasonably believes force is necessary to prevent or terminate a trespass,
  * The trespass is made or attempted by force or in a violent and tumultuous manner,
  * The person reasonably believes the trespass is for the purpose of committing violence or a forcible felony that poses imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury to someone on the property.

### Summary of Alaska Gun Laws

Alaska is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. There is no firearms registration, no permit required to purchase firearms, and no background check needed to buy a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry is legal in Alaska for any person who is legally allowed to possess a firearm. The minimum age to open carry is 21. Some areas are off-limits, including K-12 schools and any place where intoxicating liquor is sold for on-site consumption.

Concealed carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years of age or older who can legally possess a firearm — a permit is not required. Residents who seek to be exempt from background checks when purchasing additional firearms or who want to carry a firearm in other states can obtain a concealed handgun permit to use in states with which Alaska has a reciprocity agreement. Concealed handgun permits are issued by the Alaska State Police and require a state-approved firearms training course. Alaska does not issue permits to non-residents. Since Alaska has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

  * Sexual assault;
  * Sexual abuse of a minor; or

A person may not use deadly force if they know that, with complete personal safety and with complete safety for others being defended, they can avoid the necessity of using deadly force by leaving the area of the encounter, except there is no duty to retreat if the person is protecting a child or a member of their household, or is on premises that the person:

  * Owns or leases;
  * Resides in, temporarily or permanently;

### Summary of Connecticut Gun Laws

### Connecticut Gun Laws

Connecticut operates as a may-issue state, where local law enforcement has discretion in granting handgun carry permits based on a “suitability clause”. This clause applies to both new permit issuance and revocations. Obtaining a permit involves a two-step process: first, applying for a temporary permit locally, and then submitting another application at the state level through the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP).

### Handgun Purchase Requirements

To purchase a handgun in Connecticut, one must hold a Connecticut Pistol Permit (CTPP) or obtain a Certificate of Eligibility for Pistol and Revolvers or Long Guns or Ammunition. Private handgun sales necessitate a background check performed by a federally licensed dealer.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry is permitted in Connecticut with a CTPP, with a minimum age requirement of 21. As of October 1, 2023, open carry is illegal. Both residents and non-residents with a valid CCW license from their home state can apply for a CTPP. Certain locations, such as schools and state parks, are off-limits for concealed carry. Applicants must complete a state-approved firearms training course that includes live-fire exercises. Connecticut does not recognize permits from other states.

### Use of Physical Force

### Defense of Person

Individuals may use reasonable physical force to defend themselves or others from imminent physical force. Deadly force is only justified if there is a reasonable belief that the other person is using or about to use deadly force or inflict great bodily harm.

### Defense of Property

Reasonable physical force can be used to prevent attempted larceny or criminal mischief involving property. Deadly force is permissible only in defense of a person, not property.

### Defense of Premises

Persons in control of premises can use reasonable physical force to prevent or stop criminal trespass. Deadly force is allowed under specific circumstances, including defense against a trespasser committing arson or a violent crime, or to prevent unlawful entry into a dwelling or place of work.

[Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann §§ 53a-19, 53a-20 & 53a-21]

### Self-Defense

Connecticut incorporates the Castle Doctrine, which allows individuals to use physical force in defense of their premises without a duty to retreat. However, outside of one’s home, there is a duty to retreat before resorting to physical force.

### Summary of Idaho Gun Laws

Idaho is a shall-issue state for concealed carry, with concealed weapon licenses issued at the local level by county sheriffs. No license is needed to purchase a firearm from a private individual, no background check is required, there is no waiting period, and there is no firearms registration in the state. Background checks are required if purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL). However, an Idaho Concealed Weapons License (CWL) exempts the holder from the federal requirement of a background check prior to the purchase of a firearm.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal without a license in Idaho for anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm. Some areas are off-limits, including elementary schools and courthouses.

### Permitless Concealed Carry

Permitless concealed carry became legal as of March 2020. This allows any U.S. citizen over the age of 18 who can legally possess a firearm, or any current member of the armed forces of the United States, to lawfully carry a concealed firearm for self-defense without a license.

### Concealed Weapons Licenses (CWL)

Idaho offers two types of CWLs:

  1. **Standard CWL** : Covers concealed weapons including any dirk, dirk knife, bowie knife, dagger, pistol, revolver, or any other deadly or dangerous weapon.
  2. **Enhanced CWL** : Available for purposes of reciprocity for those who wish to travel out of state. Some states will only accept the enhanced version of Idaho’s license.



Both types require the applicant to be at least 18 years old. Idaho issues CWLs to residents and non-residents. Concealed carry licenses require a firearms training course that has been state-approved or experience with a firearm through participation in an organized shooting competition or military service.

### Self-Defense Laws

The defense of self or another does not require a person to wait until he or she ascertains whether the danger is apparent or real. A person confronted with such danger has a clear right to act upon appearances such as would influence the action of a reasonable person.

### Defense of Place

A person using force or deadly force in defense of a habitation, place of business or employment, or occupied vehicle is presumed to have acted reasonably and had a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or serious bodily injury if the force is used against a person whose entry or attempted entry is unlawful and is made or attempted by use of force, in a violent and tumultuous manner, surreptitiously or by stealth, or for the purpose of committing a felony.

### Liability

A person is released from liability when protecting oneself or family by reasonable means necessary or when coming to the aid of another whom he or she reasonably believes to be in imminent danger of or the victim of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, murder, or other heinous crime.

> Legal information provided is for reference and not legal advice. Consult an attorney for specific legal concerns.

### Summary of South Dakota Gun Laws

### General Information

South Dakota is currently a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Permits are processed at the county level by the sheriff’s office. No permits, firearms registration, or background checks are required to buy a handgun from a private individual.

### Open Carry

Open carry is legal in South Dakota without a permit. The minimum age is 18 years old. Based on an unofficial 2004 Attorney General Opinion, without a permit, handguns in a vehicle must be in plain sight. Some areas are off-limits, including elementary and secondary schools and school buses.

### Permitless Carry

South Dakota is now a permitless carry state. Anyone at least 18 years old who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a concealed carry permit. For reciprocity purposes, the state issues Concealed Pistol Permits (CPP) to residents, as well as members of the military and their spouses stationed in South Dakota. There are three permits available: Regular, Gold Card, and Enhanced.

  1. **Regular Permit** : Allows holders to carry concealed and is recognized in a number of other states.
  2. **Gold Card Permit** : In addition to the benefits of a regular permit, proves passage of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) when purchasing a firearm, resulting in no required waiting period.
  3. **Enhanced Permit** : Requires a firearms training course, provides the purchase background check exemption, and is recognized in seven more states than the regular license.



### Reciprocity

South Dakota recognizes permits issued by all states.

### Defense Laws

#### Defense of Dwelling or Residence — Force — Deadly Force

A person who is in a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle in which they have a right to be has no duty to retreat, has the right to stand their ground, and has the right to use:

  * Force if they reasonably believe that using force is necessary to defend themselves or another against the imminent use of unlawful force.
  * Deadly force if they reasonably believe that using deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony.



A person is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm to themselves or another when using or threatening to use defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm if the person against whom the defensive force was used had unlawfully entered or was in the process of unlawfully entering a dwelling, residence, or occupied vehicle.

#### Deadly Force — Defense of Person

A person is justified in using deadly force if they reasonably believe that using deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another, or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. There is no duty to retreat and they have the right to stand their ground.

#### Immunity

A person who uses or threatens to use force, as permitted in this statute, is justified and is immune from criminal prosecution and from civil liability for the use or threatened use of such force brought by the person against whom force was used or threatened.

[S.D. Codified Laws § 22–18–4]

#### Force — Defense of Property Other Than a Dwelling

A person is justified in using force, other than deadly force, against another if and to the extent they reasonably believe that using force is necessary to prevent or terminate another’s trespass on, or criminal interference with, real property other than a dwelling. There is no duty to retreat.

#### Deadly Force — Defense of Property Other Than a Dwelling

A person is justified in using deadly force only if they reasonably believe that the use of deadly force is necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. There is no duty to retreat and they have the right to stand their ground if they are in a place where they have a right to be.

#### Self-Defense

South Dakota is a Castle Doctrine state and has a “stand your ground” law. There is no duty to retreat as long as the force used is justified, and the law applies as long as the person is in a place where they have the right to be.

### South Dakota Concealed Carry Permit Renewal Process

### Step 1

The holder of an enhanced permit may renew the permit through the sheriff of the county where the holder resides. The period for renewal begins 180 days before the permit expires and ends 30 days after expiration. Effective February 6, 2024, the renewal period begins twelve months before the permit expires and ends thirty days after expiration. The holder must:

  * Present proof of successfully completing the live fire component of a qualifying handgun course during the renewal period.
  * Provide evidence of receiving instruction regarding the use of force standards and relevant criminal statutory changes.
  * Pay the renewal fee.
  * Pay the fingerprint background check fee.

If the holder does not renew the enhanced permit within 30 days of expiration, they must reapply for a new enhanced permit.

The holder of a gold card permit may renew the permit starting 90 days before it expires and ending 30 days after expiration. Effective July 1, 2021, this period extends to 180 days before expiration. The holder must pay the renewal fee and pass a criminal background check and a check utilizing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Effective July 1, 2023, this will be amended to require a criminal background check consisting of a computer check of available online records.

The holder of a regular permit may renew it beginning 90 days prior to expiration. There is a 30-day grace period to renew the permit. During this grace period, the permit holder may continue to carry a concealed pistol. However, law enforcement may issue a warning ticket to notify the permit holder of the expired status. This grace period does not apply to any permit holder who commits a crime that would make it unlawful for them to possess a gun or who attempted to renew the permit but was denied.

Additional firearm training is required if a permit has expired for more than 30 days.

### Step 2

Imagine a world where anybody regardless of age, experience, and expertise could brandish a gun. Yikes Right?

Well, this is why before you can legally own a gun, talk less of concealing it; you need to meet certain requirements set out by a certain group of laws known as “gun laws”.

These laws differ in states and the requirements for a concealed carry Florida will be different in some ways, if not its entirety, from that of another state, say Illinois.

We need not worry about Illinois or any other state as we will be focusing solely on concealed carry Florida and all that it entails in this article.

### Florida Gun laws

Florida has a relatively strict concealed carry law as it only allows permits for concealed carry weapons (CCW) and frowns upon open carry.

A concealed carry weapon is a gun that is hidden from the plain sight of the public.

It could be under your shirt or in your bag but as long as the person sitting next to you has no idea whatsoever, you are good to go.

An open carry on the other hand is a weapon that is brandished for the whole world to see.

There are however exceptions to the practice of open carry under Florida concealed carry law.

The law, in this case, states that residents and non-residents in the state are allowed to practice open carry in Florida if they meet any of the following conditions:

  * If they are traveling to or engaged in camping
  * If they are engaged in fishing
  * If they are going hunting
  * If they are engaged in lawful target shooting
  * If they are involved in the business of manufacturing, repairing, or dealing in firearms



While Florida concealed carry law is a bit lenient on concealed carry, it doesn’t mean that any Ed, Edd n Eddy can purchase a gun and conceal it.

In order to make this possible, individuals living or visiting in Florida need to meet Florida concealed carry requirements.

We will further expatiate these requirements below.

### Florida CCW Reciprocity

As a “shall issue” state, Florida issues its concealed carry licenses to both residents and non-residents alike as long as they are at least 21 years old or under 21 if he or she is a member or veteran of US armed forces.

They also have CCW reciprocity agreements in place with other states.

This means that they agree to recognize concealed carry weapons whose permits are legal and were issued by other states.

As long as the states agree to also recognize concealed carry weapons issued by them.

The Florida CCW reciprocity recognizes 37 states including Arizona and Ohio while 13 states including California and New York do not recognize the Florida CCW permit

### How Does Florida CCW Reciprocity Work?

As stated earlier, Florida is a “shall issue” state that recognizes concealed carry permits from other states as long as they satisfy Florida concealed carry requirements.

It is pertinent to know that these laws vary in different states and something accepted in a state might be deemed unacceptable in another state.

An example of this is the practice of open carry which is prohibited in Florida but accepted in some states such as Arizona. In this case, such a permit will not be recognized by Florida concealed carry law.

Basically, as long as you have a permit in any of the states the Florida CCW reciprocity covers and you meet the requirements for a Florida concealed carry, you need not go for a Florida CCW application when you visit.

In lieu of this, it is important to read up on the states covered by the Florida CCW reciprocity arrangement and the ones that aren’t so you don’t end up in trouble for ignorance.

### Who Can Own a Florida Concealed Carry Permit?

### What Places Are Off Limits For Concealed Carry Florida?

These places include but not limited to the following:

  * Schools, colleges, or university facilities: With the school shootings happening frequently coupled with the fact that kids in schools aren’t usually of legal age to be in possession of or in close proximity to a gun, this is a no brainer.
  * Jails, prisons, or detention facilities: The last thing we want is someone harming or arming the inmates or detainees.
  * Bars: While no one would stop you from walking into a bar with your CCWs, the problem would arise when you try to handle them while drinking or under the influence of alcoholic drinks.

### Maryland Open Carry Laws

Gun control laws in the U.S. remain highly controversial due to increases in gun violence and mass shootings, prompting public demand for laws to protect the public. At the same time, lawmakers must balance safety concerns with individuals’ right to own guns. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have upheld an individual’s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, influencing the drafting of firearm-related laws.

Each state’s gun laws vary, reflecting specific local concerns and political climates. Maryland has more restrictive gun laws than many other states, including an assault weapons ban passed in 2013 following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Maryland Gun Control Laws

Maryland’s gun control laws are comprehensive, addressing the purchase, possession, use, and carry of firearms. The state also restricts who can possess guns and bans certain dangerous firearms and accessories.

To keep guns out of the wrong hands, Maryland prohibits individuals under 21 from possessing handguns or assault weapons and those under 18 from purchasing long guns (rifles, shotguns) or ammunition. Additionally, convicted felons and individuals with specific other criminal convictions, as well as those adjudicated as incompetent or not legally responsible due to mental health issues, are banned from possessing firearms and ammunition.

In 2018, Maryland passed a red flag law allowing police officers or family members to petition a court to remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others.

### Maryland Permit Laws

Maryland requires anyone purchasing a handgun or assault weapon to be at least 21 years old and complete an application for a purchase license. Those seeking to buy, rent, or receive a handgun must also complete an approved firearms safety training course and obtain a handgun qualification license (HQL).

The Maryland State Police oversees the permit application process through its licensing division. A criminal background check is required for all firearm transactions, whether through licensed dealers or private transactions. Gun dealers must also be licensed to operate a firearms business in the state.

Individuals seeking to wear and carry a handgun, concealed or open, must apply for a concealed carry permit. Without this permit, they are limited to carrying the firearm only at their residence, on land they own, or at their place of business. Concealed carry permits are available to individuals who are 21 years old and otherwise eligible under state laws.

### Location Prohibitions

Maryland law prohibits carrying firearms in certain locations, with common exemptions for on-duty law enforcement officers and active members of the Armed Forces. These prohibited locations include:

  * Areas for children and vulnerable adults (e.g., preschools, schools)
  * Public infrastructure and government buildings (e.g., state and local government buildings, university buildings, polling locations)
  * Special purpose areas (e.g., stadiums, museums, amusement parks, racetracks, video lottery facilities, establishments that serve alcohol or cannabis for consumption)
  * Private property open to the public unless explicitly permitted by signage
  * Demonstrations in a public place or in a vehicle within 1,000 feet when law enforcement has provided notice



### Preemption Law

Maryland state law generally preempts localities from passing gun regulations that conflict with state laws. However, exceptions exist for local government regulations involving minors and the discharge of guns, except at shooting ranges. Cities like Baltimore and Annapolis can regulate gun-related conduct in or within 100 feet of parks, churches, schools, public buildings, and other places of public assembly.

### Overview of Maryland Gun Control Laws

Maryland’s gun control laws are outlined in the following statutes:

  * **Maryland Code, Criminal Law, Title 4, Sections 4–101 through 4–407**

### Nebraska Open Carry Laws

Federal and state gun laws in the United States cover a wide range of aspects concerning the sale, purchase, possession, and use of firearms. While federal laws change infrequently, state laws can vary significantly and are subject to more frequent updates. These laws often dictate who can purchase firearms, establish procedures for background checks and waiting periods, and define the legality of concealed and open carry.

### Constitutional Context

The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens the right to bear arms for traditional purposes such as self-defense. This constitutional protection has led to legal challenges against state and local laws that restrict firearm possession or use. A notable recent case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), underscored the right of individuals to carry firearms in public for self-defense purposes, requiring state regulations to use objective criteria in issuing permits.

### Impact of the Bruen Decision

Following the Bruen decision, state and local governments across the country, including Nebraska, have been prompted to consider constitutional carry laws. These laws allow individuals to carry firearms in public without a permit, whether concealed or openly carried, for self-defense purposes.

### Concealed Carry Laws in Nebraska

In Nebraska, individuals aged 21 and older, who are not otherwise prohibited, can carry a concealed handgun with or without a concealed handgun permit. Certain premises open to the public can restrict concealed carry by posting signs, and specific locations like police stations, courts, and schools are off-limits for concealed carry.

### Background Checks and Waiting Periods

Nebraska requires background checks for handgun purchases through licensed dealers or private sales, with exceptions for certain transactions. There is no state-mandated waiting period for firearm purchases in Nebraska.

### Purchasing Firearms

Georgia gun law does not require a permit to purchase, registration of firearms, or the licensing of owners. A permit to carry is only instituted for firearms that can be legally categorized as handguns. Under Georgia gun law, it is unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to possess a handgun. Consequently, it is illegal for any person to give, sell, or transfer a handgun to anyone under the age of 18. However, there are exceptions in which a minor may possess a handgun. A minor may possess a handgun with the permission of a parent, legal guardian, or under the supervision of a qualified or certified instructor, or professional.

### Massachusetts Open Carry Laws

### Massachusetts Open Carry Laws

Massachusetts has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. The state has extensive gun license requirements related to firearm ownership, possession, and use. Massachusetts also has a ban on assault weapons, the kind often used in mass shootings. In 2021, it had the lowest gun violence death rate in the U.S.

Strong gun control laws do not resolve all public safety concerns related to firearm violence. Those ineligible to buy or possess a gun in Massachusetts may travel to a state with few restrictions to obtain a weapon.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

Faced with the constitutional right to bear arms as written in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, states must also balance their gun regulations with the rights of law-abiding gun owners.

### Federal Firearms Laws

With a divided Congress, new firearms laws are rare at the national level. Consensus can be hard to find.

Longstanding federal laws limit the ownership of certain dangerous weapons like machine guns and prohibit certain persons from possessing guns. Law enforcement officers also use the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.

### Massachusetts Gun Control Laws

Massachusetts gun laws are comprehensive and seek to prevent the illegal possession and use of firearms. State licensing regulations provide for universal background checks. Every firearm purchase, sale, or transfer must comply with state requirements for review of the buyer’s criminal and/or mental health history.

### Gun License Laws

To purchase, possess, and carry a firearm throughout the state, Massachusetts residents must apply for a License to Carry Firearms (LTC). With the LTC permit, you can purchase, possess, and transport all legal handguns, rifles, shotguns, magazines, feeding devices, and ammunition. Residents who seek to purchase, possess, and transport only non-large capacity rifles and shotguns apply for a Firearm Identification Card (FID).

For most jurisdictions, the licensing authority is the local chief of police. To secure the issuance of either type of permit, an applicant needs to complete a state-approved firearms safety course or a qualifying hunter education course. The applicant must also submit their fingerprints and pass the required background check.

Massachusetts does not engage in reciprocity with other states regarding concealed carry permits. Nonresidents who are U.S. citizens and have a concealed carry license from another state may carry a pistol or revolver into Massachusetts in some situations. They must file their request for a temporary license with the Firearms Records Bureau. Such licenses will only be granted for limited purposes that include:

  * Taking part in a pistol or revolver competition
  * Attending a meeting or exhibition of a firearms collectors’ group
  * For hunting, with the license or permit on their person



### Storage Law

State law allows those with a valid gun permit to carry or have a firearm under their control. When a gun owner does not have direct control over the firearm, there are specific regulations about storage.

For example, the owner or authorized user of a gun must store or keep the firearm secured in a locked container. Otherwise, the weapon must be equipped with a mechanical lock or other safety device that makes it inoperable for anyone other than the owner or authorized user.

### Local Gun Regulations

Massachusetts firearms laws also allow cities and counties to enact their own firearm restrictions in certain situations. In some cases, these local laws may be stricter than state law.

Gun owners should inform themselves about state and local laws. Your local police department will provide such information. For example, in Boston, the city provides an online guide for firearm ownership.

### Efforts to Regulate Ghost Guns

Recent efforts by state lawmakers to regulate undetectable or “ghost” guns may bear fruit in 2024. Both the State Senate and the State House passed provisions to outlaw guns created through 3D printing that do not have serial numbers and may pass undetected through metal detectors.

A conference committee will seek to work out differences between the bills and present a final version for approval this year.

### Michigan Open Carry Laws

Laws regulating the purchase, possession, use, and carrying of firearms vary from state to state. With each mass shooting, concerns grow about gun violence, and the prevalence of firearm-related deaths in childhood accidents and suicide also raises issues about gun safety.

State legislators may respond to these matters with stricter gun regulations in some states. However, they often try to balance public safety with the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Michigan gun laws reflect that struggle. In terms of gun control, the state falls somewhere in the middle of the pack.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Firearms Law

Federal gun laws navigate many of the same challenges seen at the state level. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the public’s right to bear arms while federal law enforcement agencies seek to control and regulate dangerous weapons. The federal government provides licensing requirements for gun dealers and enforces prohibitions to keep guns out of the hands of felons and other prohibited persons.

Under federal law, a licensed gun dealer must refer all gun purchases for a criminal background check prior to delivery. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) assists in this process.

### Michigan Gun Control Laws

In Michigan, tragedy has brought changes in the law and in the resolve to hold violent offenders accountable. In 2021, a Michigan student shot and killed four students and injured seven others at Oxford High School. In 2023, a lone gunman on the campus of Michigan State University killed four students and injured seven others before taking his own life. State prosecutors convicted the high school shooter, obtaining a sentence of life in prison without parole. They also charged both parents of the shooter with four counts of involuntary manslaughter for buying the gun used in the crime and disregarding their son’s mental health issues and threatening behavior. Both parents were convicted by juries in separate trials.

### New Laws

The Michigan legislature enacted new gun regulations after these incidents, becoming the 21st state to adopt a red flag law. In Michigan, family and household members, law enforcement, and health care providers can file for a court to issue an extreme risk protection order. The law provides an opportunity for a court to hear evidence of whether a person presents a serious risk of physical harm to self or others if they have access to a firearm.

The state also closed legal loopholes to provide universal background checks on all firearm purchases in the state. Gun buyers will now be subject to a background check whether the purchase occurs before a licensed dealer or through a private sale. State lawmakers also imposed firearm prohibitions on those with misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and passed a safe storage law to help prevent children from accessing loaded firearms.

### License and Carry Laws

Unlike some states, Michigan requires that citizens apply for a purchase license before buying a firearm. This includes handguns and long guns. Sales records of handgun purchases must be shared with law enforcement. The state also requires that citizens who want to carry a concealed firearm must first obtain a concealed pistol license (CPL). As a result, the state vets anyone purchasing a firearm by running a criminal background check prior to the delivery of the weapon.

The Michigan State Police provide information on the concealed carry permit process. Those who have a valid CPL do not have to obtain a purchase license each time they buy a firearm.

Like other states, Michigan provides a list of restricted locations where gun owners generally cannot take a firearm. These include:

  * Schools
  * Depository financial institutions, their subsidiaries, and their affiliates
  * Churches and other houses of worship
  * Courts
  * Theaters
  * Sports arenas
  * Daycare centers
  * Hospitals
  * Licensed liquor establishments
  * Dormitory or classroom of a university or college



It should be noted that there are often exemptions for law enforcement officers, security personnel, and those with a valid CPL. Gun owners should verify the status of a particular location in advance.

In 2020, issues related to security at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing arose after armed protesters arrived in the building opposing the extension of state lockdown orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the Michigan State Capitol Commission adopted a no-weapons policy within the Capitol building. Exceptions to the policy are severely limited.

### Kansas Open Carry Laws

State laws that control and regulate firearms can vary greatly. Legislators must respond to constituent concerns about gun violence and gun rights. The response in Kansas reflects a strong desire to infringe on the right to bear arms minimally. In contrast, neighboring Colorado imposes more restrictions on firearms to protect the public. Each state must strike a balance of competing interests.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

The right to bear arms appears in the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment and several state constitutions. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that it is an individual right to arm oneself for self-defense and other lawful purposes. As a result, gun law and regulation challenges gain greater court scrutiny.

State residents are subject to federal and state laws that regulate firearms. The federal government regulates interstate commerce in firearms, requires registration of certain weapons like machine guns, and manages a licensing program for federal firearms dealers.

Federal law also bans possession of firearms by certain people, including felons, those using illegal drugs, those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, and others. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is a federal program that helps state and local law enforcement identify those who can’t have a firearm under federal law.

### Kansas Gun Laws

Kansas did not enact a concealed handgun permit law until 2007 when it passed the Personal and Family Protection Act. Applicants for a concealed carry permit had to meet eligibility criteria and pass a criminal background check before the state issued a permit.

In 2015, the state adopted a permitless carry law. Under permitless carry, any gun owner who is 21 or older may carry a concealed firearm on or about their person without a permit. They must be law-abiding and cannot fall into a prohibited category. The office of the Kansas Attorney General still issues handgun permits so residents can qualify for reciprocity with other states.

As with other states, Kansas law allows banning firearms in certain locations. The public may not bring firearms into the capitol buildings in Topeka, the governor’s home or grounds, any county courthouse (unless local authorities permit), or any state-owned or leased buildings with conspicuous signs saying guns are prohibited. But those who follow Kansas concealed carry law (permitted or permitless) may still have firearms in these areas. The lawful carrying of a concealed handgun can happen in most public access areas of state or municipal buildings.

The exception is where the government has placed adequate security measures, such as armed guards and metal detectors, at all public entrances. State law says that the government can ban anyone from carrying firearms in secure areas of a law enforcement agency, a correctional facility, a jail, or a courtroom (where they take adequate security measures). Firearms bans may also stand against anyone in certain other public buildings, including public-owned medical care facilities, indigent health care clinics, adult care homes, and community mental health centers.

Critics contend that Kansas gun control laws are too lax. Kansas doesn’t have certain safeguards that other states have in place. For example, it doesn’t require those engaging in private gun sales to get a criminal background check for the buyer. The state does not require gun owners to register their firearms or report lost or stolen guns. It also doesn’t regulate assault weapons or transportation of firearms in motor vehicles.

### The Second Amendment and the Right to Bear Arms

The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution forms the basis for Colorado’s approach to gun regulation. It states, “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” This amendment has sparked numerous debates and interpretations, influencing Colorado’s gun laws.

### Concealed Carry Permits

In Colorado, concealed carry of firearms is regulated by state law. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) oversees the issuance of concealed handgun permits. Applicants must meet certain eligibility criteria, including being at least 21 years old, demonstrating handgun competency, and being a legal U.S. resident. Applicants must also not have a felony conviction or a restraining order against them.

### Background Checks

Colorado mandates background checks for all firearms sales, whether conducted by licensed dealers or private individuals. These checks, conducted through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), aim to prevent firearms from falling into the hands of prohibited individuals, including convicted felons and those with certain mental health adjudications.

### Universal Background Checks

Colorado has implemented universal background checks, requiring that even private sales or transfers of firearms between individuals undergo a background check. This law closes potential loopholes in gun sales, ensuring all buyers are subject to the same scrutiny.

### High-Capacity Magazine Ban

Colorado restricts the use of high-capacity magazines. It is illegal to manufacture, sell, or transfer magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition. Individuals who owned such magazines prior to the ban are allowed to keep them.

### Assault Weapons Ban

While Colorado does not have a comprehensive assault weapons ban, some localities have their own restrictions on certain firearms and accessories. These regulations vary by jurisdiction, creating a patchwork of gun laws across the state.

### Red Flag Law

Colorado’s “Extreme Risk Protection Order” (ERPO) law, also known as the Red Flag law, allows law enforcement and family members to petition the court to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others due to mental health issues or violent behavior. This law aims to prevent potential tragedies by temporarily disarming individuals in crisis.

### Waiting Periods

Colorado does not have a mandatory waiting period for purchasing firearms. Once a background check is completed and the buyer passes, they can take possession of the firearm immediately.

### Open Carry Laws

Colorado generally allows open carry of firearms without a permit for individuals aged 18 or older. However, local ordinances may impose restrictions or regulations on open carry in certain areas or during specific events. Gun owners must be aware of and comply with local laws.

### Firearm Storage Laws

Colorado has no specific laws regarding firearm storage in private homes. However, responsible gun ownership and safe storage practices are strongly encouraged to prevent accidents and unauthorized access to firearms.

### Firearm Sales to Minors

It is illegal to sell or transfer a handgun to anyone under 18 and a long gun (shotgun or rifle) to anyone under 18 without the consent of their parent or legal guardian. Federal law prohibits licensed dealers from selling handguns to individuals under 21.

### Stand Your Ground Laws

Colorado has a “Stand Your Ground” law, allowing individuals to use force, including deadly force, to defend themselves or others if they reasonably believe they are in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury. The law does not require individuals to retreat before using force.

### Reciprocity Agreements

Colorado has reciprocity agreements with many other states regarding concealed carry permits. A valid Colorado concealed carry permit may be recognized in other states, and vice versa. It is crucial to check specific reciprocity agreements and regulations of each state when traveling with firearms.

### Gun-Free Zones

Certain locations, such as schools, government buildings, and private property with posted signs, are designated as gun-free zones in Colorado. Firearms are generally prohibited in these areas, and violating these restrictions can result in legal consequences.

### Prohibited Weapons

Colorado law prohibits the possession of certain weapons, including explosive devices, machine guns, and short-barreled shotguns, unless the individual has obtained the necessary federal permits.

### Reporting Stolen or Lost Firearms

Gun owners in Colorado must report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement within five days of discovering the loss or theft. This reporting requirement helps track firearms that may be used in criminal activities.

### Future Developments

Gun laws and regulations can evolve due to changes in legislation and public sentiment. Gun owners and enthusiasts in Colorado should stay informed about any updates or amendments to existing laws.

### Conclusion

Colorado’s gun laws and regulations aim to balance the rights of gun owners with public safety. Understanding and complying with these laws is essential for residents and visitors.

  * Permit holders enjoy reciprocity in certain states but face restrictions in federal buildings, schools, and places serving alcohol.

### Iowa Open Carry Laws

As the national debate regarding gun control and the rights of gun owners continues, states must strike their own balance in their gun laws and regulations. State legislators often respond to incidents of gun violence by assessing the role of law in improving gun safety.

Although the Second Amendment permits individuals to keep and bear arms, states can outlaw certain weapons and accessories. They can also establish licenses and permits for purchasing firearms and carrying concealed firearms in public.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 (as amended) sets a baseline of federal laws related to interstate commerce in firearms, including licensing and regulation for those who manufacture, produce, and sell guns. Among other things, federal law prohibits the possession or ownership of firearms by persons with felony convictions, misdemeanor domestic violence convictions, impairment due to mental illness, or substance abuse. Federal firearms dealers must conduct background checks on all gun purchases through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### Iowa Gun Laws

In 2021, Iowa enacted new laws, including a “permitless carry” law and made the permit application to acquire a firearm optional. As a result, gun sales between private individuals no longer require a background check. The permitless carry law allows law-abiding individuals to carry a loaded firearm on their person, either open or concealed, in public.

Iowa law still provides exceptions where the presence of a firearm is illegal. Under state law and regulations, this includes:

  * Within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a public or private elementary or secondary school or park (weapons-free zones)
  * School buses
  * Casinos



Under federal law, individuals cannot bring firearms to:

  * Post offices and their parking lots
  * Federal facilities
  * IRS offices
  * Federal courthouses
  * Airports (secure areas)
  * Ranger stations
  * Federal buildings in federal parks



The status of gun bans in sensitive areas has become volatile since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022). In that case, the Court ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to carry arms for purposes such as self-defense in public. It overturned a 1911 law that gave state authorities discretion in issuing concealed carry permits if an applicant showed a special need. The Court held that regulations burdening the individual right to bear arms must be reviewed case by case, and the government must show that the regulation is consistent with traditional, historical firearms regulation in the U.S.

Iowans also passed a state constitutional amendment in 2022. It provides:

“The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The sovereign state of Iowa affirms and recognizes this right to be a fundamental individual right. Any and all restrictions of this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.”

### Iowa Department of Public Safety Permitting Process

The Iowa Department of Public Safety continues to oversee a permitting process to aid in reciprocity with other states. An individual may complete a permit application available at the sheriff’s office of their county of residence. Iowa permits include:

  * Permit to acquire a pistol or revolver
  * Nonprofessional carry weapons permit
  * Professional carry weapons permit



Iowans can purchase long guns (rifles and shotguns) once they are 18 years old. To purchase or possess a handgun (pistol or revolver) or get a carry weapons permit, a resident must be 21 years old. Certain exceptions apply for persons 18–20 who are on duty as peace officers, security guards, correctional officers, or members of the military.

Nonprofessional carry permit applicants must show they have met state-issued training requirements, which may include completion of a training course through the National Rifle Association (NRA) or other organizations approved by the Department of Public Safety. Professional carry permits are issued to various law enforcement officers, those engaged in private investigative work, or those who work as security guards.

While Iowa imposes no waiting period for gun purchases, buyers must be of legal age and not fall under legal prohibitions for possession, such as having a felony conviction. Although Iowa does not ban assault weapons, some firearms remain illegal. For example, in Iowa, machine guns are illegal, with limited exceptions for law enforcement and the military. Possession of firearm suppressors (silencers), short-barreled shotguns, or short-barreled rifles is illegal if not compliant with federal law.

  * Any bullet containing any explosive mixture capable of exploding upon impact
  * Suppressors (silencers)

### Overview of Pennsylvania Gun Laws

Pennsylvania’s approach to gun regulation reflects a balancing act between ensuring public safety and respecting the rights of gun owners.

### Context and Federal Landscape

Despite frequent proposals, new federal gun laws are rare due to political gridlock. Federal regulations control licensing for firearms dealers and restrict ownership of certain weapons, including machine guns and bump stocks.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Pennsylvania’s Legislative Landscape

Pennsylvania has relatively stringent gun laws compared to other states, shaped by a politically divided General Assembly. These laws aim to address gun violence while respecting Second Amendment rights.

### Regulation of Firearm Purchases

All handgun purchases in Pennsylvania require a completed application and background check through the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS). Handgun sales must go through licensed dealers or county sheriff offices, bringing the state closer to universal background checks.

### Key Provisions

Pennsylvania does not mandate a waiting period for gun purchases and does not have an assault weapons ban. Certain individuals are prohibited from firearm possession, and it is illegal to provide firearms to minors or prohibited persons.

### License to Carry Firearms (LTC)

Individuals aged 21 and older can apply for an LTC permit in Pennsylvania to carry firearms concealed, except at home or in their place of business. The application process involves the county sheriff’s office and does not require firearms training for eligibility.

### Location Restrictions

Firearms are prohibited in locations such as courts, state Capitol buildings, schools, universities, and private properties with posted signs, except for law enforcement personnel.

### Legal Challenges and Second Amendment Interpretations

Recent court decisions, like in Lara v. Commissioner and Range v. Attorney General, have scrutinized Pennsylvania’s gun laws under the Second Amendment, emphasizing historical tests for firearm regulations.

### Alabama Open Carry Laws

Alabama is known for its robust tradition of gun ownership and has recently made significant changes to its gun laws. These adjustments have impacted various aspects of gun ownership and usage within the state. Here’s an in-depth exploration of Alabama’s evolving gun laws and their implications:

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Historical Context

Alabama has historically upheld strong traditions of gun ownership, reflecting the rights granted under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. For many years, the state maintained lenient laws regarding firearm registration and licensing, with minimal enforcement of provisions.

### Recent Changes

In recent years, Alabama has implemented several changes aimed at tightening gun laws and enhancing public safety:

#### Permitless Carry Law

One of the most notable changes is the adoption of a permitless carry law, enacted in May 2021. This law allows individuals aged 21 and older to carry concealed handguns without a permit or mandatory training. It also permits the carrying of firearms in vehicles without a license, which supporters argue is beneficial for personal safety during travel.

Opponents have expressed concerns that the law may lead to increased gun-related incidents due to lack of training among permitless carriers.

#### Stricter Gun Dealer Regulations

Alabama has strengthened regulations for gun dealers, requiring them to maintain detailed records of firearm sales and undergo thorough background checks. These measures aim to curb illegal gun sales and enhance accountability within the firearms market.

#### Red Flag Law

Introduced in 2019, Alabama’s Red Flag Law enables family members or law enforcement officials to petition for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others. This law provides a legal framework to prevent firearm misuse during mental health crises.

#### Enhanced Concealed Carry Permits

The state has enhanced its concealed carry permit process, now requiring applicants to complete firearms training, undergo comprehensive background checks, and mental health evaluations. These stricter requirements aim to ensure that only qualified individuals receive concealed carry permits.

### General Overview of Missouri Gun Laws

Missouri gun laws are among the weakest in the country, but such leniency has not significantly affected the state’s violent crime statistics. This contrast can be attributed to the state’s cultural emphasis on the right to carry guns. To illustrate this attitude toward gun control, here is a quick reference chart on licenses, registrations, and permits. For clarity, handguns and rifles are divided into two groups.

### Rifles and Shotguns

  * No permit is required to purchase rifles and shotguns.
  * Registration of rifles and shotguns is not required under Missouri gun law.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * A permit to carry shotguns and rifles is not required.



### Handguns

  * No permit is necessary to purchase a handgun.
  * Registration of handguns is not required.
  * Ownership licenses are not required.
  * The right to carry handguns requires a license.



### Licensing and Registration Requirements

Licenses of ownership and registration of firearms are not mandatory under Missouri gun law. State permits are also not required for the purchase of handguns or long guns in Missouri. Miscellaneous restrictions regarding the use of such firearms are fairly generic according to Missouri gun legislation.

### Possession Regulations

  * It is a misdemeanor to possess an unloaded firearm under the influence of drugs or alcohol (it is a felony if the weapon is loaded).
  * The only other regulation regarding possession under Missouri gun law is that it is unlawful for a felon (within five years from imprisonment), fugitive, or habitual drug user to possess a concealable firearm. Like many states in the Midwest and Deep South, Missouri gun law is very loose and has minimal regulation.

Connecticut requires the registration of certain types of firearms. While the majority of firearms are exempt, all weapons classified as assault weapons must be registered with the state. However, no permit is required for purchasing firearms, except for handguns.

### Eligibility for Firearm Purchase

To be eligible to purchase a firearm in Connecticut, a person must be at least 21 years old, deemed capable of handling a firearm safely as per federal statutes, and possess a handgun eligibility certificate if seeking to purchase handguns. This certificate must be issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety, and there is a two-week waiting period from the date the application is submitted.

Once the application is approved, the certificate is issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety pending receipt of a background check from the FBI. The handgun eligibility certificate is then issued to the prospective firearms purchaser within 60 days of the commissioner receiving the FBI background check. The certificate is valid for up to five years from the day it is issued.

### Louisiana Open Carry Laws

Louisiana maintains some of the most permissive gun laws in the United States, reflecting a strong commitment to gun rights while balancing public safety considerations. Here’s an overview of Louisiana’s open carry laws and regulations:

### Minnesota Open Carry Laws

Gun control remains a controversial topic in the daily news feed. At one end is the right for citizens to bear arms for traditional reasons like self-defense, while at the other is the challenge to public safety when governments appear helpless to end mass shootings throughout the nation. In recent years, there has been little agreement at the federal level on gun laws. In Minnesota and other states, striking a reasonable balance often falls to state legislators and officials.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Law

Federal law begins with a review of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and its interpretation by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Second Amendment states:

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.”

In the case of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court found that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to possess or own a gun for self-defense. More recently, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), the Court ruled that this right extends to arming oneself in public. These decisions altered the landscape of the litigation of gun rights in America.

As a result, any state regulation today may face a challenge in court. Courts will assess whether the law in question aligns with a traditional framework for firearms regulation in U.S. history.

Congress has faced conflict over gun rights and gun control for some time, so changes in federal firearms law are rare. Under the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), the federal government regulates interstate commerce in firearms. It requires those who manufacture, sell, or import firearms as their business to obtain a federal firearms license. Private sellers who don’t engage in firearm sales for profit like a business fall outside the regulation scheme.

Federal law bans citizens from owning machine guns. It also sets forth categories of persons prohibited from possession of a firearm, such as felons and those convicted of domestic violence. The GCA bars a firearm dealer from selling shotguns and rifles (long guns) to those under 18 years of age and handguns to those under 21 years of age. Under its Brady Act amendments, it set up the National Background Check System (NICS) and a minimum waiting period to allow background checks to occur.

### State Law

Federal law provides a baseline for firearm regulation. It provides a floor that states cannot go below. Typically, state gun laws provide additional regulations that balance protecting the public from gun violence with the rights of gun owners. This can appear in state-issued waiting periods, registration requirements, concealed carry permitting, and further prohibitions on who may own, possess, or use a firearm.

### Minnesota Gun Control Laws

Minnesota gun laws do not require the registration of firearms. A citizen can purchase traditional rifles and shotguns without a permit. Purchase of a handgun, however, requires a valid permit that will include a criminal background check. Likewise, the purchase or transfer of a pistol or a semi-automatic military-style assault weapon will require completing a purchase/transfer permit.

Applicants for a gun permit in Minnesota must undergo a criminal background check through the Minnesota Crime Information System and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Those seeking to purchase a firearm may seek a permit from their local police chief or county sheriff.

Minnesota also requires a gun permit to carry a gun in public. A permit to carry constitutes a permit to purchase as well, so you do not have to seek two permits in that circumstance. Minnesota’s regulatory scheme makes it a “shall issue” state. This means that the state has objective criteria for eligibility. If a person meets the criteria, then the government shall issue the permit. Issuance does not occur at the subjective discretion of the police chief or sheriff.

In general, you need a permit to carry a firearm in a motor vehicle and must transport it unloaded and under safe storage regulations.

There are some situations where a permit to carry is not required, such as:

  * To keep or carry about the place of business, home, premises, or on land one controls
  * To carry a pistol from the purchase point to one’s home, or business, or for repairs
  * To carry a pistol between one’s home and place of business
  * To carry a pistol in the woods, fields, or upon the waters for hunting or target shooting in a safe area
  * To transport a pistol in a motor vehicle, snowmobile, or boat if it is unloaded and properly secured



Minnesota law also sets out prohibited locations for firearms in certain public places and in private locations where the owner has posted clear signs or personally notified the gun possessor. These locations may be off limits whether engaged in concealed carry or open carry.

The law bans possession of a firearm on school property. School property includes any public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school campus, a school bus that is transporting school children, or a childcare center when children are present.

Minnesota also has a state preemption law that works to restrict local governments from passing firearm regulations that conflict with state law on the same issue.

### Relevant Statutes (Laws)

Minnesota’s gun control laws can be found in Minnesota Statutes:

  * Section 609.66: Dangerous Weapons; Prohibition on firearms on school property
  * Section 609.67: Machine Guns and Short-Barreled Shotguns
  * Section 624.713: Certain Persons Not to Possess Firearms
  * Section 624.7132: Report of Transfer of Firearms



### Illegal Arms

The following firearms and devices are illegal to possess, with the exception of law enforcement officers and members of the Armed Forces:

  * Machine guns or machine gun conversion kits
  * Short-barreled shotguns
  * Trigger activators



Minnesota also bans the possession or use of:

  * Spring guns
  * Saturday Night Special pistols
  * Swivel guns and set guns (deer hunting)



### Waiting Period

There is a 30-day waiting period for handguns and military-style assault weapons. The police chief or sheriff can waive any portion of the waiting period in situations where they determine the applicant is not disqualified before the expiration of the time period or that access is required sooner due to a threat to the life of the applicant or any family members in their household.

### Who May Not Possess Firearms

  * Minors, but federal and state regulations may provide limited exceptions like under parental supervision, and as of 2024 there is pending legislation challenging this
  * Persons subject to an extreme risk protection order (red flag law)
  * Persons prohibited under federal law (See 18 U.S.C. Section 922g)
  * A person convicted of domestic assault with a firearm, stalking, and certain other crimes
  * A person with a protection order for domestic violence or domestic child abuse
  * A person convicted of a crime of violence, including juvenile adjudications and those in diversion programs, unless the case is now dismissed
  * A person convicted of certain misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors set forth in the statute in the last three years, including domestic assault against a family or household member
  * A person who is or has ever been committed by judicial determination to be mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or mentally ill and dangerous to the public, to a treatment facility, or found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of mental illness and not restored
  * A person convicted for unlawful use, possession, or sale of a controlled substance, with exceptions for certain marijuana use for those 21 or over
  * A person who’s been committed for treatment for habitual use of a controlled substance or marijuana or for being chemically dependent and rights have not been restored
  * A peace officer who is informally admitted to a treatment facility for chemical dependency unless they receive a certificate for discharge
  * A person who is an alien, illegally or unlawfully in the U.S.
  * A person who has renounced U.S. citizenship

### Purchasing Firearms

Hawaii gun law, unlike many states in the United States, requires any person wishing to purchase or obtain a firearm to apply for a Hawaii gun permit that allows the transaction of firearms. The Hawaii gun permit to purchase extends to shotguns, rifles, and handguns. An individual must first apply for the permit to the chief of police pertaining to the county where the applicant resides or their place of business is located. The applicant must be at least 21 years of age and a citizen of the United States.

There is a fourteen-day waiting period for the Hawaii gun permit to purchase firearms after the application is submitted. The permits themselves are delegated with specific restrictions depending on the type of firearm being purchased or transferred. In the case of rifles or shotguns, a permit is valid for a period of one year, and the permit holder can make subsequent purchases of shotguns or rifles within that time period. In the case of handguns, a separate application and permit are required for each purchase.

### Federal and State Dynamics

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) oversees federal firearms regulations, which set standards for licensed dealers and restrict ownership of certain weapons. States like Oregon supplement federal laws with additional measures tailored to local needs.

### Oregon’s Legislative Landscape

Oregon’s constitution guarantees the right to bear arms while accommodating diverse urban and rural concerns. Major cities like Portland coexist with expansive public lands, influencing the state’s approach to firearm legislation.

### Open Carry and Assault Weapons

In Oregon, open carry of firearms is generally permitted, but restrictions apply in sensitive locations and urban areas concerned with public safety. The state does not currently prohibit assault weapons.

### Recent Legislation

In 2022, Oregon voters narrowly approved Measure 114, which introduced a ban on high-capacity magazines and mandated firearm purchase permits. This measure has faced legal challenges in state and federal courts.

### Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

To carry a concealed handgun in Oregon, residents must obtain a CHL, except when carrying a firearm at home or in their place of business. Applicants undergo a thorough process that includes a criminal background check and firearms competency demonstration.

### Restrictions and Location Prohibitions

CHL holders are subject to restrictions, including bans on carrying firearms in courthouses, secure correctional facility areas, and commercial airports. Oregon does not recognize reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry licenses.

### Bans and Prohibitions

Oregon law prohibits undetectable firearms, defined as those not detectable by metal detectors or X-ray devices, and regulates the possession of unfinished firearm frames and receivers.

### California’s Gun Control Laws

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*2CrN0uuGhKOQlnOlF3s5ag.png)

California has some of the most restrictive gun control laws in the United States, including a 10-day waiting period for firearm purchases and bans on assault weapons and firearms often associated with mass shootings.

The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence rates California’s gun safety laws highly, giving them an “A” rating. Lawmakers face the challenge of balancing gun violence prevention with gun owners’ rights, particularly following recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the Second Amendment.

### Federal Firearms Law

While states handle most day-to-day firearm regulations, federal laws apply nationwide. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), part of the U.S. Department of Justice, oversees federal firearms licenses and investigates license holders. Federal laws restrict possession of certain dangerous weapons and prohibit ownership by specific individuals, such as convicted felons.

### California Gun Control Laws

California’s comprehensive gun laws aim to prevent illegal firearm use and possession. Initiatives like the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, established by Attorney General Rob Bonta, focus on reducing gun-related injuries and deaths.

### Regulations on Gun Purchases and Sales

California requires firearm buyers to obtain a Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) by passing a written exam and being at least 18 years old. Concealed carry license holders and law enforcement officers are exempt.

Only licensed dealers may sell firearms, and buyers must provide personal information for the Dealers’ Record of Sale (DROS), which is retained by the California DOJ. There is a mandatory 10-day waiting period for background checks, extendable to 30 days if needed.

Buyers must perform a safe-handling demonstration in the presence of a certified instructor before taking possession of a firearm. Gun shows must adhere to strict regulations, including background checks for purchasers.

Certain individuals, such as convicted felons and those convicted of specific domestic violence offenses, are prohibited from owning firearms in California.

### Carrying Concealed Weapons License

California requires a permit for carrying a concealed handgun. Applicants must be 21 or older, a state resident, and not disqualified by state or federal law. They must also complete an approved firearms safety course.

Concealed carry permits come with restrictions on carrying firearms in public places, including many sensitive locations like schools and airports. Recent legislation aims to expand these restrictions, though legal challenges have delayed implementation.

An entertainment firearms permit is available for filmmaking purposes, allowing certain regulations to be waived for up to one year.

### Assault Weapons and Magazine Capacity Restrictions

California bans several dangerous weapons, including assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, with limited exceptions for military and law enforcement personnel.

### Safe Storage and Motor Vehicle Regulations

Laws on safe firearm storage are designed to prevent access by children and prohibited individuals. Criminal penalties apply if a negligently stored firearm is accessed by a child or prohibited person, especially if it results in harm.

Firearms must be transported in a motor vehicle while unloaded and in a locked container or the trunk. Long guns must also be unloaded.

### Overview of California Gun Control Laws

California’s gun laws are among the strictest in the country. Understanding these regulations is crucial to avoid potential felony charges for violations.

### New York Gun Control Laws

New York has some of the strictest gun control laws in the United States, particularly following the enactment of the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013, known as the NY SAFE Act, in response to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down most of New York’s restrictions on carrying handguns in public in the case of New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

In response, New York swiftly passed the Concealed Carry Improvement Act in July 2022 to impose new restrictions. However, a federal district court temporarily blocked the law in October 2022. Shortly thereafter, a federal appeals court granted emergency relief to New York, allowing the Concealed Carry Improvement Act to take effect and remanding the case to the district court for further review.

### New York Gun Control Laws Overview

**Relevant Statutes (Laws):**

  * New York Penal Law, Chapter 40, Article 265, Sections 265.00 through 265.55
  * Article 400, Sections 400.00 through 400.20



**Illegal Arms:** In New York, it is illegal to possess machine guns, short-barreled rifles, and short-barreled shotguns. Additionally, possession of firearms, rifles, or shotguns in sensitive areas or on private property without explicit consent is prohibited.

**Waiting Period:** There is no waiting period to purchase a gun in New York, but a license is required to purchase a handgun.

**Who May Not Own:** A firearm license is necessary to possess handguns in New York, and certain individuals are prohibited from owning long guns, including those convicted of serious offenses or deemed unfit by medical authorities.

**License Required:** A license is mandatory for handgun possession in New York. It’s important to note that New York City has distinct gun laws, and not all permits are universally valid across the state.

**Concealed Carry License Required:** New York requires a concealed carry license, with restrictions in sensitive locations such as airports, government buildings, schools, and public transit.

**Open Carry Allowed:** Open carry of handguns is prohibited in New York, but there are no specific restrictions on the open carrying of long guns in public.

### Places Off-Limits Even With a Permit/License

#### Lawful Weapons Carrier Definition

A “Lawful Weapons Carrier” includes anyone licensed under Code Section 16–11–129, eligible for a license, residents from other states who meet the eligibility requirements (excluding residency), and those licensed in other states.

### Carrying Weapons; License Requirements

#### Authorized Locations

Lawful carriers may carry weapons in parks, historic sites, recreational areas, wildlife management areas, and on public transportation, except where prohibited by federal law.

#### Unauthorized Locations

Carrying a weapon or long gun is prohibited in the following locations:

  * Government buildings without being a lawful carrier
  * Courthouses
  * Jails or prisons
  * Places of worship unless permitted
  * State mental health facilities for involuntary treatment
  * Nuclear power facilities
  * Within 150 feet of polling places during elections



### Exceptions

  * Legal proceedings with secured weapons as exhibits
  * Notification and compliance with security personnel directives upon arrival at prohibited locations
  * Weapons in a motor vehicle’s locked compartment or firearms rack



#### Government Buildings

Lawful carriers may carry in government buildings when open and not restricted by security. Failure to clear security must result in immediate exit to avoid misdemeanor charges. Non-lawful carriers attempting entry with a weapon face misdemeanor charges.

#### Places of Worship

Violations by lawful carriers in places of worship result in a fine up to $100. Non-lawful carriers face misdemeanor charges.

### General Provisions

This section does not affect exemptions provided under Code Section 16–11–130.

### Do “No Gun” Signs Have the Force of Law?

### No

In Georgia, “No Firearm” signs do not have the force of law unless posted on property explicitly mentioned in state law as off-limits for those with a permit or license to carry. If you are asked to leave a location not specified in the law, you must comply. Refusal to leave can result in legal charges. Always be cautious, as responding police officers may not be familiar with specific trespass laws and could arrest you, even if you are within your rights.

#### Recommendation

It is advisable not to enter establishments with “No Firearms” signs, regardless of state laws regarding signage. Consider giving a “No Guns = No Money” card to the owner of such establishments. Respecting property owners’ rights, even when disagreeing, is an important aspect of responsible gun ownership and upholding the Second Amendment.

### Parking Lot Storage Law

### Overview

Georgia law prohibits private or public employers, including the state and its subdivisions, from enforcing policies that allow searching locked, privately owned vehicles of employees or guests on employer parking lots.

### Employment Conditions

Employers cannot require prospective employees to agree not to have firearms or ammunition in their locked vehicles on the employer’s parking lot, provided the employee is a lawful weapons carrier.

### Exceptions

  * Searches by law enforcement with valid warrants or based on probable cause under exigent circumstances
  * Vehicles owned or leased by the employer
  * Situations where accessing a vehicle is necessary to prevent immediate threats to health, life, or safety
  * Searches consented to by employees for loss prevention based on probable cause



### Special Cases

Certain locations and situations are exempt from these provisions, including secure parking areas, penal institutions, utility facilities, and areas with federal restrictions.

### Liability

Employers are not liable for incidents involving firearms stored in vehicles unless they commit a criminal act or knew someone would use a firearm criminally on their premises. There is no new duty imposed on employers regarding employee at-will status.

### Legal Actions

Employers complying with safety laws have a complete defense in related actions. Plaintiffs in lawsuits about workplace firearm use may be liable for legal costs if the employer prevails.

### Property Rights

The rights of property owners or those in control of property through leases or agreements are maintained, particularly if they are also employers.

### RV/Car Carry Without a Permit/License

### Overview

Under Georgia law, individuals who are not prohibited from possessing firearms can carry a long gun on their property or inside their home, motor vehicle, or place of business.

#### Carrying in Vehicles

Individuals not prohibited by law may carry a long gun in their vehicle. Lawful weapons carriers can transport handguns or long guns in private vehicles. However, private property owners can exclude or eject individuals carrying weapons on their property, subject to certain conditions.

### Reciprocity and Recognition

Individuals licensed to carry in states that recognize Georgia permits may carry in Georgia, provided they comply with state laws. Licenses are not recognized for individuals under 21. The Attorney General maintains a list of states that recognize Georgia licenses.

### Specific Locations

Lawful weapons carriers may carry firearms in parks, historic sites, recreational areas, wildlife management areas, and on public transportation, except where prohibited by federal law.

#### Note

No permit is required to carry a firearm inside your own vehicle, either openly or concealed. However, carrying in someone else’s vehicle requires the owner’s permission.

### State Preemption

### Legislative Findings

The regulation of firearms and other weapons is considered a state-wide concern. The General Assembly states that the lawful design, marketing, manufacture, and sale of firearms and ammunition are not inherently dangerous and do not constitute a nuisance.

### Preemption of Local Regulation

No county or municipal corporation, nor any state agency, board, department, commission, or authority, may regulate:

  * Gun shows
  * Possession, ownership, transport, carrying, transfer, sale, purchase, licensing, or registration of firearms or other weapons
  * Firearms dealers or dealers of other weapons
  * Dealers in components of firearms or other weapons



Only the state has the authority to bring lawsuits against firearms or ammunition manufacturers, trade associations, or dealers for issues related to their lawful design, manufacture, marketing, or sale.

### Local Regulations

Local governments may regulate the transport, carrying, or possession of firearms by their employees or volunteers during their official duties, provided these regulations align with state and federal laws. Sheriffs, chiefs of police, and commanding officers of law enforcement agencies have specific authority over their personnel regarding firearms regulations.

### Municipal and County Ordinances

Municipalities or counties may require the ownership of guns by heads of households. Municipalities or counties may limit or prohibit the discharge of firearms within their boundaries.

### Definition of Weapon

The term “weapon” includes any device intended for offense or defense, such as firearms, bladed devices, clubs, electric stun devices, and defense sprays.

### Legal Recourse

Individuals aggrieved by violations of this section may bring an action for damages, including actual damages or $100, equitable relief, attorney’s fees, and other appropriate relief.

### Emergency Powers of Governor

### Declaration and Duration of Emergency

The Governor can declare a state of emergency or disaster due to natural or human-caused events, pandemics, or public health emergencies. A special session of the General Assembly is required for public health emergencies, convening two days after such a declaration. The state of emergency continues until the Governor determines the threat has passed or conditions have improved. It cannot exceed 30 days without renewal, and the General Assembly can terminate it anytime.

### Gun Control Laws in the U.S.: A Challenging Consensus

Finding consensus on gun control laws in Congress and state legislatures remains a major challenge in the U.S. On the one hand, the U.S. Constitution and most state constitutions protect citizens’ right to bear arms. On the other, gun violence disrupts communities daily.

In 2023, the Gun Violence Archive reported 656 mass shootings in America, defining a mass shooting as an incident where four or more persons are killed or injured, not including the shooter.

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides a check on both state and federal gun laws. Recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court support an individual’s right to possess firearms for self-defense and other purposes. Still, the right to own guns is not absolute and remains subject to reasonable regulations consistent with U.S. history and tradition.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Firearms Regulations

The federal government provides limited regulations on firearms. These include mandated registration of certain dangerous weapons and a licensing framework for firearms dealers and manufacturers. Federal law identifies categories of persons who cannot possess firearms, such as convicted felons. Federal firearms dealers must refer each purchase for criminal background checks to help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.

More detailed regulations on who can purchase, sell, own, possess, and carry firearms fall under state law. As such, gun control laws vary from one state to another.

### Montana Gun Control Laws

A recent study concluded that Montana residents own the most guns per capita in the U.S. Despite being one of the largest states by land mass, Montana has just over one million residents. The estimate is that 65% of Montana’s households contain a gun, making Montana gun control laws some of the most permissive in the country. A Montana resident doesn’t need to get a gun license, register their guns, or get a permit to purchase or possess firearms.

Montana law does not require a waiting period on firearm purchases. The state does not ban assault weapons or high-capacity magazines. Montana provides no specific regulations on carrying firearms in motor vehicles. Its public safety efforts focus more on prohibiting possession by those with certain felony convictions and providing penalties for crimes involving the use of a firearm.

In 2021, Montana became a permitless carry state. This means that a person who can legally possess a firearm can also carry a concealed firearm in public without first passing a background check. Montana still offers a regular concealed carry permit and an enhanced concealed carry permit. Permit holders may qualify for reciprocity to carry under the firearms laws of other states. Having a state permit can also bypass a background check each time you purchase a new firearm.

To obtain a regular or enhanced Montana permit, complete an application with your local sheriff’s office. Montana is a “shall issue” state for concealed handgun permits. If an applicant meets all the eligibility criteria and passes a background check, the county sheriff must issue the permit. Eligibility information is available on the Montana Department of Justice website.

The Montana Attorney General also provides a list of states whose permits are recognized by Montana. Nonresidents can carry concealed weapons if their state’s permit requires a background check before its issuance and they have both the permit and a photo ID on their person. Qualified law enforcement officers can also carry a concealed weapon without a permit.

While Montana allows both concealed and open carry of firearms in public, there are certain location restrictions. In most situations, you cannot possess or carry a firearm in these places:

  * School buildings as determined by the school board
  * Courtrooms and areas of a courthouse as determined by order of a judge or court
  * Portions of buildings used for state or local government offices that have been restricted (exception for state concealed weapon permit holders)
  * Secure treatment facilities of the Department of Health and Human Services
  * Correctional, detention, and treatment facilities operated by the Department of Corrections
  * Detention facilities or secure areas of a local law enforcement agency of a city or county
  * At or beyond the security screening checkpoint in a public, commercial airport
  * Federal buildings
  * Military reservations operated by the U.S.
  * Private property where the owner or person in control expressly prohibits firearms
  * Universities and college campuses as determined by the board of regents, as per the 2022 Montana Supreme Court case Board of Regents of High Education v. Knudsen

### Who May Not Own

A person may not possess a firearm who:

  * Has been convicted of a felony where the person received an additional sentence for use, display, or brandishing of a dangerous weapon but not where use of the weapon was an element of the crime itself
  * Has been convicted of an offense under U.S. law or another state’s law that is equivalent to a Montana felony where the person received an additional sentence for use, display, or brandishing of a dangerous weapon but not where the use of the weapon was an element of the crime itself

### Open Carry Allowed?

Open carry is permitted in Montana. No license is required to open carry.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

Montanans who are not prohibited under federal or state law from possessing a firearm can carry a concealed firearm without a state permit. The state continues to offer a regular and an enhanced permit for reciprocity in other states and other reasons. An applicant for a regular permit to carry a concealed weapon must:

  * Be a U.S. citizen or permanent lawful resident
  * Be 18 years of age or older and hold a valid Montana driver’s license or other form of photo identification issued by the state
  * Have been a resident of Montana for at least six months

An applicant for an enhanced concealed carry permit must meet these same requirements and must be at least 21 years old. They must also submit fingerprints and proof of firearm training that includes live-fire exercises of at least 98 rounds of ammunition.

### Machine Gun Laws

It is not a crime to possess a machine gun under Montana law. However, federal laws may apply. Montana criminalizes possession or use of a machine gun in a crime or for an aggressive or offensive purpose.

### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

Montana’s penalties for illegal firearm possession depend on the crime. The following are penalties for specific offenses:

  * Possession or use of a machine gun in connection with a violent crime is a felony, punishable by 20 years in prison.
  * Possession or use of a machine gun for an offensive purpose is a felony, punishable by 10 years in prison.
  * Unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted person is a felony, punishable by two to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $50,000, or both.

  * Possession of a silencer for use in a criminal offense is a felony, punishable by five to 30 years, a fine of up to $20,000, or both.
  * Possession of a sawed-off firearm is a misdemeanor, punishable by five days to six months in jail, a fine of $200 to $500, or both. A second or subsequent offense (or possessing a sawed-off firearm after having been convicted of a felony) is punishable by up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.



### Penalties for Illegal Possession on or Near School Grounds

Illegal possession of a firearm on school property is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail, a fine of up to $500, or both.

### Red Flag Law?

No. In 2023, Montana legislators tabled a bill proposing a red flag law, preventing the bill from moving forward for debate and a vote.

### Universal Background Checks?

No. Montana does not require a background check for firearms transactions that occur between private individuals.

### Stand Your Ground Law?

Yes. A person who is not the aggressor can use sufficient force, including deadly force, in self-defense to an attack. If they are lawfully in a place or location, they need not first retreat or summon law enforcement assistance.

### Laws Regulating Firearms in Michigan

Laws regulating the purchase, possession, use, and carrying of firearms vary from state to state. Concerns about gun violence grow with each mass shooting, and the prevalence of firearm-related deaths in childhood accidents and suicides raises issues about gun safety.

State legislators may respond to these matters with stricter gun regulations, often trying to balance public safety with the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Michigan gun laws reflect that struggle, with the state falling somewhere in the middle of the pack in terms of gun control.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Firearms Law

Federal gun laws navigate many of the same challenges seen at the state level. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the public’s right to bear arms while federal law enforcement agencies seek to control and regulate dangerous weapons.

The federal government provides licensing requirements for gun dealers and enforces prohibitions to keep guns out of the hands of felons and other prohibited persons. Under federal law, a licensed gun dealer must refer all gun purchases for a criminal background check prior to delivery. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) assists in this process.

### Michigan Gun Control Laws

In Michigan, tragedy has brought changes in the law and in the resolve to hold violent offenders accountable. In 2021, a Michigan student shot and killed four students and injured seven others at Oxford High School. In 2023, a lone gunman on the campus of Michigan State University killed four students and injured seven others before taking his own life.

State prosecutors convicted the high school shooter, obtaining a sentence of life in prison without parole. They also charged both parents of the shooter with four counts of involuntary manslaughter for buying the gun used in the crime and disregarding their son’s mental health issues and threatening behavior. Both parents were convicted by juries in separate trials.

### New Laws

The Michigan legislature enacted new gun regulations after these incidents, becoming the 21st state to adopt a red flag law. In Michigan, family and household members, law enforcement, and health care providers can file for a court to issue an extreme risk protection order. The law provides an opportunity for a court to hear evidence of whether a person presents a serious risk of physical harm to self or others if they have access to a firearm.

The state also closed legal loopholes to provide universal background checks on all firearm purchases. Gun buyers will now be subject to a background check whether the purchase occurs before a licensed dealer or through a private sale. State lawmakers also imposed firearm prohibitions on those with misdemeanor domestic violence convictions and passed a safe storage law to help prevent children from accessing loaded firearms.

### License and Carry Laws

Unlike some states, Michigan requires that citizens apply for a purchase license before buying a firearm, including handguns and long guns. Sales records of handgun purchases must be shared with law enforcement. The state also requires that citizens who want to carry a concealed firearm must first obtain a concealed pistol license (CPL). As a result, the state vets anyone purchasing a firearm by running a criminal background check prior to the delivery of the weapon.

The Michigan State Police provide information on the concealed carry permit process. Those who have a valid CPL do not have to obtain a purchase license each time they buy a firearm.

Michigan provides a list of restricted locations where gun owners generally cannot take a firearm. These include:

  * Schools
  * Depository financial institutions, their subsidiaries, and their affiliates
  * Churches and other houses of worship
  * Courts
  * Theaters
  * Sports arenas
  * Daycare centers
  * Hospitals
  * Licensed liquor establishments
  * Dormitory or classroom of a university or college



There are often exemptions for law enforcement officers, security personnel, and those with a valid CPL. Gun owners should verify the status of a particular location in advance.

In 2020, issues related to security at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing arose after armed protesters arrived in the building opposing the extension of state lockdown orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the Michigan State Capitol Commission adopted a no-weapons policy within the Capitol building. Exceptions to the policy are severely limited.

### Gun Control Landscape in the United States

Gun control is a contentious issue in the United States, where state laws complement federal regulations. New Jersey stands out for its strict gun control measures, reflecting consensus among state legislators and the governor’s office in recent years.

### Public Safety Concerns and Constitutional Rights

Discussions on gun control often revolve around concerns over gun violence. Statistics show that a significant portion of gun deaths in the U.S. are due to suicides (54%) and homicides (43%), highlighting the diverse public safety issues associated with firearms.

### Impact of Recent Legal Developments

Recent legal developments, including the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, have reshaped gun rights litigation. This decision invalidated restrictive state concealed carry permit systems, establishing new standards for evaluating state regulations that may infringe on Second Amendment rights.

### Federal Firearms Regulations

Federal laws governing firearms primarily date back to the 20th century, covering manufacturing, sale, ownership, and possession. Certain firearms, like machine guns, require strict federal registration and oversight. Federal law prohibits firearm ownership for felons, individuals with specific mental health histories, and those convicted of drug offenses.

### New Jersey’s Stringent Gun Laws

New Jersey has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, enacted under Governor Phil Murphy’s administration. These include bans on assault firearms and ghost guns, rigorous requirements for handgun purchase permits, and mandatory background checks for private firearms transactions through licensed dealers.

### Detailed Regulations in New Jersey

To purchase a handgun in New Jersey, individuals must obtain a handgun purchase permit and undergo a 7-day waiting period. A Firearms Purchaser Identification Card (FPIC) is necessary for buying rifles or shotguns, with limits on the number of handguns purchasable within a 30-day period.

Recent legislative updates have overhauled New Jersey’s concealed carry permit process, transitioning from a discretionary “justifiable need” standard to stricter requirements, including background checks, endorsements, firearms training, and liability insurance.

### Overview of Gun Control Laws in Washington State

Efforts to address gun violence have intensified in response to rising firearm deaths and mass shootings. While federal regulations exist, state-level legislation plays a pivotal role due to political challenges in Congress, resulting in varying laws across states like Washington.

### Federal Firearms Law

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) oversees federal gun licenses and enforces laws against illegal firearm trafficking. Federal regulations prohibit certain individuals, such as convicted felons, from owning firearms and established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### Washington State Gun Control Laws

Washington State has implemented stringent firearms laws to enhance safety while respecting gun owners’ rights.

#### Regulation of Gun Purchases and Sales

Washington voters have enacted several laws through ballot initiatives:

  * **Universal Background Checks (2016):** Mandates background checks for private firearm sales via licensed dealers.
  * **Red Flag Law (2017):** Allows courts to issue extreme risk protection orders to prevent firearm access by individuals posing threats.
  * **Minimum Age Requirement (2018):** Raised the minimum age for purchasing handguns and semi-automatic rifles to 21.
  * **Waiting Period and Firearms Safety Training (2023):** Requires a waiting period and proof of firearms safety training for all purchases.



#### Concealed Carry License Requirements

To carry a concealed firearm in Washington, applicants must obtain a concealed pistol license (CPL) from local law enforcement, meeting age requirements, passing background checks, and other criteria.

### Location Restrictions for Firearms

Despite a CPL, carrying firearms is restricted in specific locations such as courtrooms, schools, and public facilities, including airports and libraries. Open carry is prohibited in these areas.

### Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines

Washington prohibits assault weapons, large-capacity magazines, and accessories like bump stocks, with exceptions for certain authorized entities. Possession of these items is restricted despite bans on their sale, manufacture, import, and distribution.

### Child Access and Vehicle Restrictions

Minors under 18 face restrictions on firearm possession, with exemptions for supervised hunting or firearms training. Only those 21 or older may purchase handguns or semi-automatic rifles. Improper firearm storage leading to unauthorized access carries penalties, and loaded pistols in vehicles are regulated unless carried with a CPL.

### Relevant Washington State Gun Laws

The Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Title 9, Chapter 9.41 covers definitions, unlawful possession, concealed pistol licenses, background checks, and restrictions on firearms.

#### Illegal Arms and Waiting Period

Possession of prohibited firearms like machine guns and undetectable firearms is illegal, with a mandatory 10-day waiting period after purchase for background checks.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

Applicants for a CPL must be 21 or older, free of legal restrictions on firearm possession, and pass background checks.

### Machine Gun Laws

Except for certain pre-existing exemptions, owning or possessing machine guns in compliance with federal law is illegal in Washington.

### Right to Keep and Bear Arms in the United States

In the United States, individuals have the constitutional right to keep and bear arms for self-defense, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and supported by legal interpretations. Many states, including Utah, also affirm this right in their own constitutions.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Firearms Law

Federal firearms law, derived from the authority to regulate interstate commerce, applies uniformly across all states. It permits the legal manufacture, sale, and possession of firearms while requiring registration for certain types like machine guns and short-barreled weapons. Federal law also prohibits firearm possession by individuals posing risks to public safety, such as felons and those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. Transactions through licensed dealers necessitate FBI background checks to prevent firearms from reaching unauthorized individuals.

### Utah Gun Laws Overview

Utah’s firearm laws reflect its stance on public safety and the rights of gun owners, often imposing fewer restrictions compared to other states. Notably, Utah passed a law in 2021 allowing “permitless carry,” enabling law-abiding adults to carry concealed handguns in public without permits, provided they meet age and eligibility requirements.

### Gun Control Laws in the United States

Gun control laws in the United States spark contentious debates nationwide. While federal regulations establish minimum standards for firearm manufacture, ownership, and use, state laws often impose stricter controls. States vary widely in their approaches, covering firearm registration, licensing for carrying permits, and more extensive prohibitions.

Federal laws primarily restrict ownership of fully automatic firearms and impose firearm disabilities on felons, drug users, and those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. Purchases from licensed dealers necessitate FBI background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### South Dakota Gun Laws Overview

South Dakota boasts some of the nation’s least restrictive gun laws. Since 2019, the state has permitted concealed carry without a permit for individuals over 18 who meet state and federal eligibility criteria. Assault weapons, large-capacity magazines, and ghost guns (undetectable firearms made from kits or 3D printers) are not banned.

The state does not mandate waiting periods for firearm purchases, and private sales can bypass background checks required in transactions with licensed dealers. South Dakota also issues concealed pistol permits for reciprocity with other states.

Three types of permits are available in South Dakota: regular, gold card, and enhanced. Requirements include age verification, absence of legal prohibitions on firearm possession, and completion of background checks. Enhanced permits additionally mandate FBI fingerprint checks and handgun proficiency courses.

South Dakota adheres to a “shall issue” policy, obligating the government to issue permits if applicants meet specified criteria. Non-residents are ineligible for permits, and local municipalities are preempted from enacting firearm regulations that diverge from state law.

Certain locations in South Dakota, such as courthouses, the State Capitol, schools, and specific licensed establishments, prohibit firearm possession, with exceptions for law enforcement and enhanced permit holders. The state offers a school sentinel program, allowing selected school employees to carry firearms for security, following training from the attorney general’s office.

### Key South Dakota Gun Control Provisions

**Relevant Statutes:** SDCL Title 22, Chapter 14; SDCL Title 23, Chapter 7; SDCL Title 13, Chapter 32.  
**Illegal Arms:** Silencers, machine guns, short shotguns, firearms with altered serial numbers.  
**Waiting Period:** None.  
**Prohibited Ownership:** Individuals with recent violent felony convictions or certain drug-related offenses, misdemeanors involving domestic violence, minors without parental presence, and those barred under federal law.

South Dakota does not mandate gun ownership licenses, and concealed carry permits are optional following the state’s shift away from mandatory requirements. Open carry is permitted statewide, subject to location-specific restrictions.

### Eligibility for Concealed Carry License

Applicants must be 18 years or older, U.S. citizens or legal residents, and residents of their county for at least 30 days before applying. They must not have felony or violent crime convictions, history of substance abuse, or pending firearm or drug offense charges. A clean National Instant Criminal Background Check is required.

### Overview of Federal and State Gun Laws

Federal and state gun laws regulate the sale, purchase, possession, and use of firearms in the U.S. While changes in federal law are infrequent, state laws frequently change and can vary significantly. State gun control laws may limit who can purchase a firearm, set procedures for background checks and waiting periods, and address the legality of concealed or open carry laws.

Nebraska gun control laws are less restrictive compared to many other states. The state has enacted more restrictions on handguns than on rifles and shotguns.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Second Amendment and Supreme Court Decision

The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides citizens with the right to bear arms for traditional purposes such as self-defense. As a result, gun owners often challenge state and local laws that ban or limit firearm possession or use. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022) involved a state regulatory scheme for issuing concealed carry permits.

In this case, petitioners argued their applications for permits to carry firearms for self-defense were denied on subjective and arbitrary grounds. The New York law allowed authorities to issue a permit when an applicant showed proper cause. The Court invalidated the law, agreeing that its subjective evaluation for permits violated the Constitution. It held that citizens have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense and that state regulations must use objective criteria such that a permit shall issue when such criteria are met. The Court also placed the burden on the government to show that a regulation is consistent with historical firearms regulation.

### Implications of the Bruen Decision

In light of the Bruen decision, state and local governments seeking to address gun violence by enacting new firearms restrictions must demonstrate how a gun control law aligns with historical firearms regulations. In several states, including Nebraska, the decision encouraged efforts to pass constitutional carry or permitless carry laws. Such laws allow citizens to carry firearms in public without a permit for purposes such as self-defense, whether the firearm is concealed or openly carried.

In Nebraska, anyone 21 years or older who is not otherwise prohibited can carry a concealed handgun with or without a concealed handgun permit. However, certain premises open to the public can prohibit non-law enforcement personnel from carrying a concealed handgun onto a premises by posting signs. Concealed carry of a handgun is not permitted at the following locations:

  * Stations of police, sheriff, or the Nebraska state patrol
  * Detention facilities, prisons, and jails
  * Courtrooms or buildings containing a courtroom
  * Polling places during a bona fide election
  * Meetings of governing bodies for cities, counties, school districts, and other political subdivisions
  * Places of worship
  * Meetings of the state legislature or committees of the legislature
  * Financial institutions
  * Professional or semi-professional sporting events and school sports events
  * Hospitals, emergency rooms, and trauma centers
  * Political rallies and fundraisers
  * Certain establishments with a liquor license



Nebraska has also passed a law that preempts local regulations of firearms that are inconsistent with state law. As a result, stricter gun ordinances and regulations in Omaha and Lincoln, the state’s two largest cities, are currently facing challenges in the courts.

### Background Checks and Self-Defense Laws

Nebraska law requires background checks for only certain purchases or transfers of firearms. Federal firearms law requires a background check on purchases from a federal firearms dealer. Nebraska gun laws require a background check on handgun purchases that occur through a dealer or in a private sale, with some exceptions for antique firearms, those purchased for a law enforcement agency, and transactions between certain family members. Private sale transfers of rifles and shotguns are not subject to background checks under state law.

Nebraska self-defense statutes do not currently include a stand-your-ground law. State law also does not provide a red flag law that permits the confiscation or prohibition of firearms from persons deemed a threat to themselves or others.

### Wyoming Gun Control Laws Overview

Wyoming gun control laws are among the least restrictive in the United States, placing few obstacles to gun ownership and purchase. In 2021, Wyoming ranked 5th highest in gun death rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Nearly half of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. come from suicide, and four in ten come from homicide.

Wyoming seeks to balance individual rights to bear arms set forth in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution with legitimate public safety concerns. It must also comply with federal firearm restrictions, including prohibitions on ownership or possession of firearms by individuals under indictment for or convicted of a felony, those convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense, and those currently subject to a domestic violence protection order.

### Wyoming Gun Control Laws

Every state has its own gun control laws that restrict the purchase and use of firearms. Wyoming, known as the Cowboy State, has relatively lenient gun control laws:

  * **No License Required** : Wyoming law does not require a license, permit, or registration to buy or own a firearm.
  * **Minimum Age** : The minimum age to buy a long gun (rifle or shotgun) is 18, and the minimum age to buy a handgun (pistol or revolver) is 21.



### Permitless Carry

  * **Residents** : Wyoming adopted a permitless carry law for residents in 2011, allowing those who would qualify for a concealed carry permit to carry without a permit.
  * **Non-Residents** : This law was expanded in 2021 to cover otherwise qualified non-residents.



### Concealed Firearms Permit (CFP)

The state maintains a CFP for residents seeking reciprocity in other states. A state permit also lets permit holders forego an otherwise required background check when purchasing a new firearm from a federally licensed dealer.

### Obtaining a Concealed Firearms Permit

  * **Authority** : The Wyoming Attorney General’s office issues permits. To apply for a CFP, contact your local sheriff’s office. The sheriff then forwards your permit application to the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) for review and background check.
  * **“Shall Issue” State** : Wyoming is a “shall issue” state, meaning that if you meet all the objective eligibility criteria, they must issue the concealed handgun permit.
  * **Validity** : Permits remain valid for five years. The state can pursue revocation if a permittee becomes ineligible in the future.



### Prohibited Locations for Firearms

Wyoming law includes a list of prohibited locations where carrying a firearm is not allowed:

  * Facilities used primarily for law enforcement or by a law enforcement agency
  * Detention facilities, prisons, or jails
  * Courtrooms (unless excepted by the judge)
  * Meetings of governmental entities
  * Meetings of the legislature or its committees
  * School, college, or professional athletic events not related to firearms
  * Places that sell liquor for consumption on premises
  * Elementary and secondary schools
  * College or university facilities (unless with consent of their security)



### Other Regulations

  * **Assault Weapons and Ghost Guns** : Wyoming law does not regulate the possession of assault weapons or ghost guns, which are firearms that can be assembled from a kit or through the use of a 3D printer.
  * **Background Checks** : No background checks are mandated for purchasing a gun through a private sale.
  * **Waiting Period** : There is no waiting period from the time of purchase to the time of delivery when buying a firearm.
  * **State Preemption Law** : Wyoming bans local authorities from passing stricter gun laws than the state.
  * **Firearms Manufactured in Wyoming** : A state law provides that firearms manufactured and not leaving Wyoming in interstate commerce do not fall under federal regulations, though this law has never been tested in court.



### Relevant Statutes

Wyoming’s gun laws can be found in Wyoming Statutes, Title 6, Chapter 8, Sections 6–8–101 through 6–8–406, and Title 21, Chapter 8, Section 21–3–132:

  * **Use or possession of a firearm by a person convicted of certain felony offenses** — Section 6–8–102
  * **Wearing or carrying concealed weapons** — Section 6–8–104
  * **Regulation of firearms** — Section 6–8–404
  * **Possession of firearms on school property** — Section 21–3–132



### Prohibited Firearms

Wyoming does not prohibit specific firearms but bans the use of a fully automatic weapon to take wildlife under its hunting regulations.

### Restrictions on Gun Ownership

Wyoming law provides that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a violent felony (except in situations where they received a pardon or had rights restored under the law)
  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a nonviolent felony (except in situations where they received a pardon or had rights restored under the law)



Federal law provides that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have been convicted of any felony in any state, territory, or other jurisdiction of the United States
  * Are a fugitive from justice
  * Are an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance
  * Have been adjudicated to be mentally defective or been committed to any mental institution

  * Have renounced U.S. citizenship
  * Are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of an intimate partner
  * Have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence



### Concealed Carry License Requirements

Wyoming issues concealed carry permits, but they are not required for a Wyoming resident or lawful U.S. citizen to carry a concealed firearm. If a resident is eligible for a permit, they may carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Permits are still available for residents who wish to be able to carry a concealed firearm in states that recognize Wyoming permits.

### Gun Control Laws in the United States

Gun control laws in the United States encompass a combination of federal and state regulations aimed at preventing gun violence. Federal law, rooted in the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms and the Gun Control Act of 1968, establishes a foundational framework. State laws then add varying degrees of restrictions or liberties.

Federal regulation of firearms began significantly with the National Firearms Act (NFA) in the 1930s, which imposed taxes on manufacturing specific firearms such as machine guns, short-barreled shotguns, and rifles with barrels under 18 inches, as well as silencers and mufflers, and required their registration.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) amended and expanded NFA provisions, broadening the list of prohibited persons who are barred from possessing or owning firearms. In the 1990s, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established under federal law.

### North Dakota’s Gun Control Laws

North Dakota’s gun laws are relatively less restrictive compared to many other states. Unlike states that mandate a waiting period for gun purchases, North Dakota does not require one. Federal law mandates a criminal background check for firearms purchased from federally licensed dealers but does not extend to private sales not involving licensed dealers.

Some states require universal background checks for all firearms purchases or transfers, but North Dakota does not enforce such a requirement.

In 2017, North Dakota enacted Constitutional Carry legislation, allowing residents to carry concealed firearms without a concealed weapons license (CWL) if they are otherwise eligible under state and federal law. Individuals must carry a valid driver’s license or state ID and cannot be prohibited from firearm possession.

There has been debate regarding the legality of carrying loaded firearms in vehicles under Constitutional Carry. The North Dakota Attorney General issued an opinion affirming that eligible individuals under Constitutional Carry can transport loaded firearms if they possess a valid state driver’s license or ID upon law enforcement request, now incorporated into state law.

### Overview of Missouri Gun Laws

Gun issues are a thorny topic. While the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, states have some freedom to regulate the sale and ownership of guns. Missouri gun control laws are relatively loose compared to other states. Missouri gun laws do not provide for waiting periods or require background checks for gun purchases from unlicensed individuals.

Gun regulations appear in both state and federal law. The federal government sets up licensing for firearms dealers and sets certain prohibitions on weapons and those who can possess them. State law may then provide restrictions on the carrying of firearms.

States can also set licensing requirements. Some states ban certain deadly weapons in response to gun violence. Others set laws to promote gun safety, often to reduce access to guns by minors.

### Missouri Gun Control Laws at a Glance

State lawmakers often struggle to balance the rights of gun owners with the need for public safety. Gun violence, such as the 2024 mass shooting at the Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City, brings the issue of guns back into public view.

The state of Missouri continues to tip the balance in favor of gun rights in most circumstances. Missouri does not ban assault weapons or require firearm owners to register their weapons. It does not require a license to purchase a firearm.

State lawmakers passed a permitless carry law in 2017 over a governor’s veto. This law enables people to carry concealed weapons without first obtaining a concealed carry license, passing a background check, or completing a firearms safety course.

Missouri law doesn’t state a minimum age for possessing a firearm. It prohibits transferring a firearm to a minor (under 18 years old) without the consent of the custodial parent or legal guardian. Exceptions apply for those in the Armed Forces or National Guard while on duty.

Under federal law, a licensed dealer cannot sell a handgun to anyone under 21 years old or a long gun to anyone under 18 years old, with limited exceptions. Missouri law likewise outlaws providing a concealable firearm to a minor.

In 2021, the Missouri General Assembly passed the Second Amendment Preservation Act. This law, signed by Governor Mike Parson, stated that Missouri would not enforce or assist in the enforcement of federal gun laws it viewed as infringements on the Second Amendment right to bear arms.

The law was struck down in a federal district court in Missouri as an unconstitutional violation of the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, among other reasons. The Eighth Circuit federal appeals court allowed the lower court’s order to stand and prevented state enforcement of the law while the case remained pending. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene early in the case, allowing the lower court rulings to stand at this time.

State laws that attempt to limit cooperation with the federal government or with federal law over firearms often confuse state and local law enforcement officers. Missouri’s law provided for the possibility of $50,000 fines against municipalities if local police officers assisted federal law enforcement or cooperated with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

The state’s appeal of the federal district court ruling remains pending in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for now.

Although Missouri is a permitless carry state, it continues to provide an optional concealed carry permit process for permit holders who seek reciprocity to carry in other states. Missourians can apply for a concealed carry permit with their local sheriff.

Permitless carry laws do not sanction those prohibited from possessing a firearm from carrying one. State and federal prohibitions on who can possess a firearm still apply.

### Location Restrictions for Firearms

Missouri law also contains location restrictions for firearms. Prohibited locations include:

  * Schools, with limited exceptions
  * Universities and colleges
  * Police, sheriff, highway patrol stations and offices
  * Polling places on election day
  * Jails, prisons, and detention facilities
  * Courthouses and courtrooms
  * Meetings of a governing body of a local government or the state General Assembly with an exception for members
  * Licensed establishments that sell liquor on premises for consumption (with limited exceptions)
  * Airports
  * Childcare facilities
  * Riverboat gambling operations open to the public (limited exceptions)
  * Amusement parks
  * Churches and other places of religious worship (limited exceptions)
  * Private property (with posted signage)
  * Certain sports arenas and stadiums
  * Hospitals accessible to the public
  * Locations prohibited under federal law



Although Missouri has a preemption law preventing cities and counties from passing gun laws in conflict with state law, it does allow these entities to prohibit firearms in their local government buildings and offices.

### Gun Control in the United States

Gun control is a contentious issue in the United States, with debates often centered around mass shootings, firearm-related suicides, and homicides. Advocates argue for stricter gun regulations to reduce these incidents, while opponents emphasize the Second Amendment rights. Many believe that responsible gun ownership and public safety can coexist.

In 2022, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was signed into law. This was the first significant federal gun control legislation since 1994. The act expanded background checks for firearm purchases by individuals under 21, created federal crimes for gun trafficking and straw purchases, required certain private sellers to obtain a federal firearms license, and provided funding for state mental health programs and red flag laws. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was instrumental in supporting this legislation.

### Alaska Gun Control Laws

Although federal laws regulate gun purchases and ownership, most gun control laws are state-level. Alaska’s gun laws are relatively minimal and less restrictive compared to other states.

### Key Provisions in Alaska Gun Laws

  * **No Waiting Period:** Alaska does not impose a waiting period for gun purchases. Instant background checks are required for purchases through federally licensed dealers, but private sales do not require background checks.
  * **Permitless Carry:** Alaska allows permitless carry of concealed weapons for law-abiding citizens. However, carrying firearms is restricted in certain locations, such as:
  * Private residences without the owner’s consent
  * Businesses where liquor is sold for consumption, with some exceptions
  * Childcare facilities and adjacent parking lots
  * Courtrooms and courthouses
  * Domestic violence or sexual assault shelters
  * Schools and school buses, without permission from the chief administrative officer
  * Any place where state or federal law prohibits handgun possession



While Alaska residents do not need a permit to carry a concealed firearm, many opt for a permit to ensure reciprocity with other states. The Alaska Department of Public Safety oversees the concealed handgun permit process. Alaska is a “shall issue” state, meaning permits are issued if applicants meet the legal requirements. When interacting with law enforcement, individuals carrying firearms must notify officers and allow them to secure the weapon during the encounter.

### Gun Control Laws in the United States

Federal and state gun control laws impose restrictions on the purchase, use, and possession of firearms across the United States. These laws vary significantly from state to state.

Given the limited gun control legislation from a divided Congress, state legislators face the challenge of balancing concerns about gun violence with the rights of law-abiding gun owners. In Ohio, a majority of lawmakers prioritize gun rights over increased regulation, resulting in fewer restrictions compared to some other states.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution plays a crucial role in shaping gun laws. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the individual right to own guns for self-defense and other lawful purposes. The court evaluates the constitutionality of laws restricting firearm possession based on historical perspectives regarding gun regulations at the time of the Constitution’s adoption.

### Ohio Gun Control Laws

Ohio’s gun control laws prohibit certain types of weapons and regulate gun purchases and ownership for specific individuals. Prohibited possessions in Ohio include sawed-off shotguns, improvised firearms known as zip guns, and military-grade weapons and ammunition. Notably, the state has not banned assault weapons or undetectable firearms (“ghost guns”).

Certain individuals are restricted from owning or possessing firearms under Ohio law, including convicted felons, individuals with substance abuse issues, and those adjudicated as mentally incompetent. Ohio does not mandate a waiting period for firearm purchases. Federally licensed dealers conduct criminal background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) before delivering firearms. Private sellers or unlicensed dealers are not required to perform such checks.

Ohio does not specify a minimum age for firearm possession, but individuals under 18 cannot purchase firearms, and those under 21 cannot purchase handguns, with exceptions for law enforcement and active-duty military members aged 18 and above.

### Ohio Concealed Carry Laws

In 2022, the Ohio General Assembly enacted permitless carry legislation. This law allows qualifying adults aged 21 and older, not prohibited from firearm possession under state or federal law, to carry concealed handguns without a concealed handgun license (CHL). Applications for a CHL are submitted to the local sheriff’s office or a neighboring county sheriff for residents and non-residents working in Ohio.

Ohio maintains its concealed carry permit system to facilitate permit-holders’ travel to states with reciprocity agreements.

While Ohio permits open and concealed carry, certain locations prohibit firearms. Prohibited locations include law enforcement facilities, state correctional facilities, airports, government buildings, schools, and places of worship. Private property owners can restrict firearms on their premises with proper signage.

### Overview of Ohio Gun Control Laws

Ohio’s main gun control statutes are outlined in the Ohio Revised Code (O.R.C.), Title 29, Sections 2923.11 through 2923.30, focusing on weapons control. These laws cover various aspects, including concealed carry without a license, possession in liquor permit premises, and restrictions near school safety zones.

Ohio prohibits specific firearms, including automatic firearms, sawed-off firearms, and certain firearm modifications. The state does not impose waiting periods for firearm purchases but restricts possession by individuals like fugitives from justice, those under indictment for felonies, and individuals with mental health adjudications.

### Gun Laws in Hawaii

### Overview of Hawaii’s Gun Death Rate and Laws

Hawaii boasted the second-lowest gun death rate in the U.S. in 2021, attributed to stringent gun control laws aimed at reducing firearm-related fatalities.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Evolution of Concealed Carry Laws

In 2022, Hawaii’s concealed carry permit regulations faced challenges following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), which struck down “may issue” licensing practices. The Court affirmed a public carry right under the Second Amendment, prompting Hawaii to reassess its permitting criteria.

### Permit Requirements and Background Checks

Hawaii mandates permits for firearm purchases, requiring applicants to undergo comprehensive background checks covering local, state, and national databases. Disqualifying factors include felony convictions, violent misdemeanors, and domestic violence charges.

### Firearm Registration

Nearly all firearms in Hawaii must be registered with local law enforcement agencies, reinforcing accountability and tracking within the state.

### Recent Legislative Changes

In 2023, Hawaii introduced a new licensing framework aligning with the Bruen decision, moving towards a “shall issue” policy contingent on objective criteria and firearms safety training. Legal challenges ensued, particularly concerning location restrictions for carrying firearms in public.

### Prohibited Locations for Carrying Firearms

Under Hawaii’s updated law, carrying firearms is restricted in various public and private locations, including:

  * Government buildings
  * Medical facilities
  * Correctional facilities
  * Alcohol-serving establishments
  * Educational institutions
  * Public transit facilities
  * Recreational areas excluding shooting ranges



### Legal Challenges and Pending Appeals

Parts of Hawaii’s new firearm legislation, particularly location restrictions, faced legal opposition. A federal court issued a temporary restraining order pending appeal, reflecting ongoing judicial scrutiny.

### Overview of Indiana Gun Control Laws

Gun control laws in the United States are governed by both federal and state regulations, aimed at balancing individual rights with public safety concerns.

### Federal Regulations

Federal law, administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), regulates firearms through licensing requirements for dealers, restrictions on dangerous firearms, and background checks via the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Indiana Gun Laws

Indiana’s state gun laws are generally less restrictive compared to other states, with specific regulations governing the purchase, possession, and use of firearms.

#### Prohibited Firearms and Ammunition

Indiana prohibits certain weapons and ammunition types, including machine guns and armor-piercing bullets, with exceptions for military and law enforcement use. Notably, Indiana does not enforce bans on assault weapons or high-capacity magazines, nor does it restrict ghost guns assembled from kits or 3D-printed.

#### Background Checks

Gun purchases through federally licensed dealers in Indiana require a criminal background check before transfer. Private sales, however, do not mandate such checks.

#### Permitless Carry Law

As of July 1, 2022, Indiana adopted a permitless carry law, allowing individuals aged 18 and older who are legally eligible to possess firearms to carry them openly or concealed without a permit.

#### Handgun Licenses

Residents and eligible non-residents may apply for a handgun license in Indiana through local law enforcement agencies. The state does not charge a fee for these licenses, although applicants must undergo a background check and provide fingerprints.

#### Restrictions on Carry

Despite its permissive carry laws, Indiana restricts firearms in specific locations, including schools, airports, state fairgrounds, casinos, jails, and certain government buildings. Private businesses and employers can also prohibit firearms on their premises.

#### Red Flag Law

Enacted in 2020, Indiana’s red flag law permits law enforcement to seize firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others. The process involves court review and may result in temporary firearm confiscation pending a final hearing.

Indiana’s approach to gun control aims to balance individual rights with public safety, reflecting a blend of permissive carry laws with measures to restrict firearms in sensitive locations and mitigate risks posed by dangerous individuals.

### Overview of Indiana Gun Control Laws

### Massachusetts Gun Control Laws

Massachusetts has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, including extensive requirements for firearm ownership, possession, and use. The state also bans assault weapons, often used in mass shootings, and had the lowest gun violence death rate in the U.S. in 2021.

While strong gun control laws address public safety concerns, those ineligible to buy or possess guns in Massachusetts may still acquire weapons in states with fewer restrictions. Balancing the constitutional right to bear arms with the need for public safety is a significant challenge for states.

### Federal Firearms Laws

New firearms laws at the federal level are rare due to a divided Congress. Existing federal laws limit ownership of certain dangerous weapons like machine guns and restrict certain individuals from possessing firearms. Law enforcement uses the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.

### Massachusetts Gun Control Laws

Massachusetts’ gun laws aim to prevent illegal possession and use of firearms, requiring universal background checks for every firearm purchase, sale, or transfer. These regulations review the buyer’s criminal and mental health history.

### Gun License Laws

Residents must apply for a License to Carry Firearms (LTC) to purchase, possess, and transport all legal handguns, rifles, shotguns, magazines, feeding devices, and ammunition. Those only seeking to purchase, possess, and transport non-large capacity rifles and shotguns apply for a Firearm Identification Card (FID).

The local chief of police is typically the licensing authority. Applicants must complete a state-approved firearms safety course or a qualifying hunter education course, submit fingerprints, and pass a background check.

Massachusetts does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states. Nonresidents with a concealed carry license from another state may carry a pistol or revolver into Massachusetts under specific conditions, such as participating in a competition, attending a firearms collectors’ meeting, or hunting with a valid license.

### Storage Law

Firearms must be secured in a locked container or equipped with a mechanical lock or safety device when not under the owner’s control. This ensures the weapon is inoperable by anyone other than the owner or authorized user.

### Local Gun Regulations

Cities and counties in Massachusetts can enact firearm restrictions that may be stricter than state laws. Gun owners should be aware of both state and local regulations. Local police departments provide information on these laws, such as Boston’s online guide for firearm ownership.

### Efforts to Regulate Ghost Guns

State lawmakers are working to regulate undetectable “ghost” guns. Both the State Senate and House have passed provisions to outlaw 3D-printed guns without serial numbers that can bypass metal detectors. A conference committee will reconcile the bills for final approval in 2024.

### Illinois Gun Laws Overview

### Federal and State Regulations

In Illinois, both federal laws (such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the National Firearms Act) and state laws play crucial roles in determining firearm legality, ownership criteria, and possession regulations. Federal laws provide a framework for interstate commerce in firearms and regulate certain categories of prohibited persons, while state laws add specific provisions tailored to local needs and circumstances.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Prohibited Weapons

Illinois law strictly prohibits the sale, use, or possession of certain types of firearms and accessories. These include fully automatic machine guns, armor-piercing ammunition, and silencers (also known as suppressors). These restrictions are aimed at limiting access to weapons deemed particularly dangerous or inappropriate for civilian use.

### Waiting Period

Prospective gun buyers in Illinois are subject to a mandatory three-day (72 hours) waiting period after completing the required purchase paperwork. This waiting period allows law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough background check on the buyer to ensure they meet all legal requirements for firearm ownership.

### Eligibility Criteria

To legally own or use firearms in Illinois, individuals must meet stringent eligibility criteria.

### Kansas Gun Control Laws

Kansas’s approach to gun control reflects a commitment to minimal restrictions on the right to bear arms, contrasting with neighboring states like Colorado, which impose more regulations. Each state balances public safety and individual rights differently.

### Constitutional and Federal Context

The right to bear arms is protected by the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment and various state constitutions. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions affirm this right for self-defense and lawful purposes, subjecting gun laws to greater scrutiny. Federal regulations govern interstate commerce in firearms, require registration of certain weapons, and prohibit firearm possession by specific individuals, including felons and those with domestic violence convictions. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) assists in enforcing these prohibitions.

### Kansas Gun Laws Overview

Kansas introduced a concealed handgun permit law in 2007 with the Personal and Family Protection Act, requiring applicants to meet eligibility criteria and pass a background check. In 2015, Kansas adopted a permitless carry law, allowing individuals 21 and older to carry concealed firearms without a permit, provided they are law-abiding and not prohibited from firearm possession. The Kansas Attorney General’s office continues to issue permits for reciprocity with other states.

### Restrictions and Prohibited Locations

Kansas law prohibits firearms in specific locations, including the capitol buildings in Topeka, the governor’s residence, certain courthouses, and state-owned buildings with posted signs. However, individuals compliant with Kansas concealed carry laws may carry firearms in most public areas unless adequate security measures, such as armed guards and metal detectors, are in place. Additional restrictions apply to secure areas of law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities, jails, courtrooms, and certain public medical and mental health facilities.

### Criticism and Lack of Safeguards

Critics argue that Kansas’s gun laws are too lenient, lacking measures like mandatory background checks for private gun sales, firearm registration, and requirements to report lost or stolen guns. The state does not regulate assault weapons or the transportation of firearms in vehicles, leading to ongoing debate about public safety versus gun rights.

### Gun Control Laws Overview

Gun control laws are a source of heated debate in both federal and state legislatures, where balancing public safety concerns with Second Amendment rights remains a challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2008 ruling affirmed an individual’s right to possess firearms at home for lawful purposes, and its 2022 decision extended this right to include carrying arms in public, imposing stricter scrutiny on regulations.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal and State Gun Control Laws

While specifics vary, common features of state gun control laws include legal possession for self-defense, hunting, and recreation, with restrictions barring individuals with criminal histories or mental health issues from firearm ownership. Misuse or carrying firearms in restricted areas such as schools and government buildings typically results in criminal charges.

### Gun Control in Vermont

#### Legal Framework

Vermont guarantees the right to bear arms under its state constitution without registration or licensing requirements. Residents and non-residents can openly or concealed carry firearms without a permit, reflecting the state’s historically permissive stance.

#### Recent Legislative Changes

Starting in 2018, Vermont enacted measures aimed at curbing gun violence, including universal background checks, raising the minimum age for firearm purchases to 21, and banning high-capacity magazines and defaced firearms.

#### Extreme Risk Protection Orders

Vermont introduced procedures for extreme risk protection orders, allowing courts to confiscate firearms from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others. This initiative also mandates safe storage and a 72-hour waiting period post-purchase, despite facing potential legal challenges.

#### Enforcement and Restrictions

Vermont strictly prohibits firearm use in locations like courthouses, schools, and hospitals under most circumstances, with penalties for violations ranging from fines to imprisonment based on the offense.

### Gun Control Landscape in the United States

Gun control remains a contentious issue in the United States, balancing federal constitutional rights with concerns over public safety. Regulation primarily occurs through state and federal laws, often leaving states to take the lead due to federal legislative challenges.

### Impact of U.S. Supreme Court Decisions

Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have significantly influenced gun rights. In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court affirmed the Second Amendment right for individuals to possess firearms for self-defense, overturning stringent D.C. handgun ownership restrictions.

In New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), the Court ruled against strict “may issue” concealed carry permit policies, reinforcing the right to carry firearms for self-defense in public.

### State Responses and Legislative Trends

In response to these rulings, several states have adopted “permitless carry” or “constitutional carry” laws. New Hampshire, for instance, implemented such legislation in 2017, emphasizing the right to self-defense without requiring government-issued permits.

### Federal Firearms Regulation

Federal firearm regulation is more limited compared to state authority. The National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 provide frameworks for taxing and regulating firearms and prohibit certain categories of individuals from owning them. Federal law mandates background checks for purchases from licensed dealers but exempts private sales.

### Colorado Gun Control Overview

Recent measures by the Colorado legislature are seen by gun control advocates as steps to reduce gun violence and enhance public safety. The nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety ranks Colorado eleventh in the U.S. for its gun laws. Colorado has recently enacted laws that increase the minimum age to purchase a handgun to 21, implement a three-day waiting period for background checks after firearm purchases, and impose restrictions on ghost guns.

Understanding Colorado’s gun laws can be challenging due to the mix of state and federal statutes. Gun owners must navigate these laws to comprehend their rights and ensure compliance. New prohibitions and regulations often face legal challenges; for instance, all three laws passed in 2023 are currently contested by gun rights advocates.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own guns for self-defense at home. In 2022, in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Court affirmed the right to carry guns in public for self-defense. This means gun control legislation is heavily scrutinized by lawmakers and courts.

Colorado gun owners must also comply with federal laws governing the purchase, sale, possession, and use of firearms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 sets the framework for firearm regulation, including a list of prohibited persons. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 expanded this list and established a federal background check system to prevent sales to felons and other prohibited individuals.

Even with Second Amendment protections, states can regulate certain weapons and accessories. In Colorado, sawed-off shotguns and silencers are illegal.

Colorado does not ban assault weapons but limits large-capacity magazines. The Colorado Supreme Court upheld this limitation in Rocky Mountain Gun Owners v. Polis (2020), ruling that it did not unduly infringe on gun rights under the state constitution.

Background checks are nearly universal in Colorado, required for all sales or transfers through firearms dealers, including private sales. Certain temporary transfers, gifts, and loans between family members are exempt. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation provides guidance on background checks and firearm prohibitions.

In 2021, Colorado revised state law to allow local jurisdictions like Denver and Boulder County to enact stricter gun control measures, such as restrictions on open carry and concealed carry, and bans on assault weapons.

In 2022, Governor Jared Polis signed the Vote Without Fear Act, prohibiting open carry within 100 feet of polling places during elections. In 2023, Colorado expanded its red flag law, enabling more individuals to request extreme risk protection orders to restrict access to firearms for those deemed a risk to themselves or others.

### Relevant Statutes (Laws)

### Rhode Island Constitutional Carry Laws

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*I9sqmhL4gQB-EqUD2O4uVw.png)

### New Gun Control Laws in Rhode Island

In 2022, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed three new gun control laws, all signed into law by Governor Dan McKee. These include:

  * Prohibition on large capacity feeding devices holding over 10 rounds of ammunition.
  * Ban on open carry of loaded shotguns and rifles on public roadways.
  * Increase in the minimum age for firearm purchases from 18 to 21 years.



Rhode Island’s firearm laws are among the stricter ones in the country. Legislators aim to balance reducing gun violence with respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners, a complex task in a nation with diverse views on gun regulation.

### Federal Firearms Oversight

Federal oversight of firearms is limited, managed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). This includes licensing for interstate firearms commerce and enforcing bans on possession by prohibited individuals. Federal law mandates background checks for firearm purchases by licensed dealers, supported by the FBI to prevent sales to felons and others barred from ownership.

### State-Level Gun Control Regulations

Most gun control regulations are set at the state level, covering issues like concealed carry permits, waiting periods for gun purchases, and restrictions on firearm possession in public places and vehicles. The Second Amendment guarantees individuals’ rights to bear arms for self-defense, a principle broadened in recent U.S. Supreme Court interpretations, such as in the case of New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022). This ruling set stricter criteria for government regulations affecting gun rights.

### Rhode Island Gun Control Laws Overview

To purchase a handgun in Rhode Island, individuals must obtain a safety certificate from the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) following a firearms safety course. This requirement excludes law enforcement, military personnel, and active-duty military.

Rhode Island issues licenses to carry handguns publicly, either concealed or openly. Licensing authorities include local governments for concealed carry and the State Attorney General for both open and concealed carry, adhering to the “shall issue” standard mandated by recent legal precedents. Unauthorized possession of a firearm can lead to felony charges, with exceptions for those carrying firearms legally licensed in other states while passing through Rhode Island.

Rhode Island mandates universal background checks for all private firearm sales and transfers. A seven-day waiting period is required between application and firearm delivery. The state’s laws do not include an assault weapons ban but prohibit certain firearms and restrict local governments from enacting conflicting gun regulations.

### Kentucky Gun Control Laws

Kentucky’s gun control laws are less restrictive compared to many other states, reflecting the state’s commitment to upholding the Second Amendment right to bear arms. This stance is contrasted with states that have more stringent regulations, particularly in response to concerns about mass shootings.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Constitutional and Federal Context

The right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which the Supreme Court has interpreted as an individual right to own firearms for self-defense, both at home and in public. Federal law sets a baseline for firearm regulations, including the legal manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms. It also identifies people banned from having firearms, such as felons and those addicted to illegal drugs. Licensed federal firearms dealers must perform background checks on potential buyers.

In cases where federal and state laws intersect, federal law generally takes precedence. Gun owners in Kentucky must comply with federal laws like the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the National Firearms Act. States may choose to enact stricter laws.

### Gun Control Laws in Kentucky

Kentucky regulates firearms but does not require permits to purchase them or limit certain assault-style weapons and accessories. The state does ban armor-piercing bullets and prohibits felons from owning firearms. Licensed dealers must conduct background checks, but private sales between unlicensed individuals do not require them.

In 2019, Kentucky adopted a “permitless carry” law, allowing individuals 21 or older and legally permitted to possess firearms to carry a concealed handgun without a state permit. Kentucky also maintains a process for obtaining a Concealed Deadly Weapon License (CDWL) for reciprocity purposes. A CDWL is available to Kentucky residents who are 21 or older. There is no minimum age or permit requirement for carrying shotguns or rifles.

To obtain a CDWL, applicants must apply at their local sheriff’s office, which forwards the application to the Kentucky State Police. Applicants must provide a certificate of completed firearms training. The State Police conduct a background investigation before issuing the license.

### Location Restrictions

Kentucky law restricts firearms in certain locations, including:

  * Police stations and sheriff’s offices
  * Detention facilities, prisons, and jails
  * Courthouses
  * Meetings of the General Assembly and its committees
  * Meetings of municipal, county, or special district governing bodies
  * Areas designated for the consumption of alcoholic beverages in licensed establishments
  * Elementary and secondary school facilities
  * Childcare facilities and daycare centers
  * Controlled areas of airports
  * Locations prohibited by federal law
  * Private businesses with clear notices prohibiting firearms



Local governments, colleges, universities, and state government units may also restrict concealed handguns on properties they control. Private property owners can ban firearms on their premises.

Kentucky has a preemption statute, meaning state law overrides local regulations in most firearms matters. For example, Louisville cannot enact an assault weapons ban if it conflicts with state law. Kentucky law also allows the carrying of firearms in motor vehicles. Firearms stored in any enclosed container, compartment, or storage space installed by the vehicle manufacturer are not considered concealed.

### Relevant Statutes

#### Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS)

  * **KRS Section 237.070** : Sale and transfer of firearms to felons
  * **KRS Section 237.080** : Prohibitions on armor-piercing ammunition

### Gun Violence and Regulations in Pennsylvania

Every state contends with its unique challenges related to gun violence. In Pennsylvania, instances of mass shootings have seen an uptick in recent years. One of the state’s deadliest incidents occurred in 2018 at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, where 11 people lost their lives and seven were injured in an anti-Semitic attack.

Beyond high-profile tragedies, gun violence remains a pervasive issue affecting communities daily. Firearm-related fatalities rank as a leading cause of death among children and teenagers, with firearms frequently involved in suicides due to their easy accessibility.

Efforts by state legislators to address gun safety concerns must navigate a delicate balance, respecting the rights of lawful gun owners while striving to enhance public safety.

### Federal Firearms Regulations

Despite periodic proposals, significant federal legislation on firearms is uncommon, often stymied by political gridlock. Existing federal laws primarily focus on restricting certain types of firearms, such as machine guns and bump stocks, which modify semi-automatic rifles to function similarly to fully automatic weapons.

Federal oversight extends to licensing requirements for firearms dealers and prohibitions on firearm possession by categories of individuals like convicted felons and illegal drug users. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) facilitates instant background checks for firearm purchases, aiming to prevent firearms from reaching prohibited persons.

### Pennsylvania Gun Laws

Pennsylvania maintains moderately stringent gun laws relative to national standards. The state’s legislative landscape reflects a divided political climate, with Republicans controlling the State Senate and Democrats holding the State House, contributing to legislative challenges regarding gun control.

Key provisions of Pennsylvania’s gun laws include mandatory background checks through the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS) for all handgun purchases. Sales of handguns, sawed-off shotguns, and sawed-off rifles necessitate involvement from licensed dealers or county sheriff’s offices.

While the state does not enforce a waiting period for firearm purchases and lacks an assault weapons ban, it does prohibit certain individuals from firearm possession and imposes penalties for supplying firearms to prohibited persons or minors.

### Pennsylvania License to Carry Firearms

Individuals aged 21 and older in Pennsylvania may apply for a License to Carry Firearms (LTC), a requirement for legally carrying concealed firearms or transporting them in vehicles. Exceptions allow firearm possession within one’s residence or place of business and under certain recreational permits.

Application procedures for an LTC permit involve submission through the county sheriff’s office, which mandates personal appearance for identification verification and photographing. Pennsylvania does not mandate completion of a firearms training course as a prerequisite for obtaining an LTC permit, differing from requirements in some other states.

### Location Restrictions

Similar to other jurisdictions, Pennsylvania prohibits firearms in designated areas like courthouses, the State Capitol, schools, and private properties displaying prohibitive signage. Exceptions exist for law enforcement personnel.

### Challenges to Pennsylvania Gun Laws

Recent judicial decisions have tested the constitutionality of Pennsylvania’s firearm regulations. In cases like Lara v. Commissioner (2024), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals scrutinized state laws against Second Amendment protections, underscoring the evolving legal landscape around gun rights.

### Nevada Gun Laws Overview

Nevada, known for its historical ties to gunslingers and mining towns, faced a significant shift in the gun control debate following a tragic incident. In 2017, a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas from a 32nd-floor hotel suite, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more. This remains the deadliest mass shooting in American history and prompted Nevada to revisit its gun control laws.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Key Legislative Changes Post-Tragedy

The Las Vegas shooter possessed 23 firearms at the time of the attack, many of which were AR-15 assault-style rifles equipped with bump stocks. Bump stocks enable semi-automatic rifles to fire similarly to fully automatic firearms. After the massacre, there were legislative moves to ban bump stocks. When Congress stalled, the Trump Administration initiated a rule change to outlaw them, a process continued by the Biden Administration. Litigation on this rule change is ongoing.

In 2019, Nevada banned bump stocks and enacted a red flag law, allowing family members or law enforcement to petition a court to confiscate firearms from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others.

### Federal Firearms Law

Federal firearms law begins with the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which grants the right to bear arms. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this as an individual right for self-defense and other lawful purposes, subject to state and federal regulations. In 2022, the Court established that regulations must be historically reasonable and not overly burdensome, prompting new challenges to various state and federal firearms laws.

Federal legislation provides a framework for the manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) licenses gun dealers and oversees certain dangerous weapons like machine guns. Federal law also restricts firearm possession for certain categories of people, such as felons.

### Nevada’s Firearms Regulations

Nevada defines a firearm as any device designed to be used as a weapon from which a projectile can be expelled through the barrel by an explosion or combustion. Handguns with barrels shorter than 12 inches are considered concealable firearms.

Nevada’s firearm regulations are relatively limited:

  * No permits required to purchase guns
  * No firearm registration
  * No gun owner licenses
  * No waiting period for firearm purchases



However, Nevada bans bump stocks, undetectable “ghost” guns, and requires background checks for private sales and transfers of firearms through a licensed dealer.

### Open and Concealed Carry

Nevada allows open carry of firearms. However, carrying a loaded rifle or shotgun inside a vehicle on public roads is illegal.

Nevada is a “shall issue” state for concealed carry permits, meaning permits must be issued to qualified applicants. Applicants must:

  * Be 21 years or older (some exceptions for military personnel)
  * Apply through their local county sheriff (non-residents can apply to any county sheriff)
  * Provide driver’s license information and fingerprints
  * Pass a criminal background check



The Nevada Department of Public Safety updates a reciprocity list annually, detailing which out-of-state permits Nevada recognizes. Carrying a concealed weapon without a permit in Nevada is a felony.

### Prohibited Locations for Firearms

Even with a concealed carry permit, firearms are prohibited in certain locations:

  * Law enforcement facilities
  * Prisons, jails, and detention centers
  * Courthouses and courtrooms
  * Public airports
  * Schools, childcare facilities, and college properties (with exceptions)
  * Public buildings with metal detectors and posted notices
  * State legislative buildings
  * Other federal, state, or local government buildings, unless permission is granted

### Gun Control Laws in Alabama

Even in states with a strong sense of an individual’s constitutional right to bear arms, some regulation is needed to keep the public safe from gun violence.

Alabama gun laws are less strict than many other states, but Alabama still regulates some aspects of firearm ownership and possession. In past years it adopted laws to help reduce access to firearms by those convicted of domestic violence and those suffering from mental illness.

State legislators must balance federal and state prohibitions and regulations with the rights of gun owners. In Alabama, public safety concerns often give way to individual rights to own and possess guns for self-defense, hunting, recreation, and other lawful purposes.

Most discussion of gun control in America today begins with a review of federal and state constitutional provisions that protect the right to bear arms. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Second Amendment to grant individuals the right to carry arms in public.

The Court’s rulings state that to uphold a state or local restriction on firearms, the local law must be based on traditional firearms regulations from U.S. history. This has led to court battles in both state and federal courts.

Existing federal law related to firearms places requirements on the legal manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms. It bans firearm possession by certain persons such as convicted felons. If someone purchases a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, the dealer must conduct a criminal background check prior to delivering the weapon.

Most background checks involve the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

### Alabama Gun Control Laws

In 2022, over the opposition of the Alabama Sheriffs Association, Governor Kay Ivey signed a new law allowing for permitless carry of concealed handguns in the state. Such laws are also known as constitutional carry. They provide that anyone who could legally possess a gun can now carry one concealed on their person without first going through the permit and background check process.

The effect of these laws is unknown. Does being in a permitless carry state empower law-abiding citizens to pack heat or provide less scrutiny to the carrying of arms by prohibited persons?

Alabama law does not contain many hallmarks of modern gun control regulation. There is no assault weapons ban or law against possessing a high-capacity magazine of ammunition. The state imposes no waiting period on buying a gun. It does not provide for universal background checks on all gun purchases.

There is no red flag law designed to assist law enforcement with keeping guns away from those who represent a threat to themselves or others.

Upon adopting its new permitless carry law, Alabama passed regulations to help law enforcement officers when they stop someone who may have a concealed firearm. When police engage a motorist or individual in an investigatory stop, anyone carrying firearms must notify the police upon an inquiry.

They also cannot touch their gun with their hands or fingers from the time of the officer’s approach until the end of the encounter unless instructed to do so by the officer. Violations can result in a Class A misdemeanor charge.

Alabama maintains a process for granting a concealed carry permit for those gun owners who seek reciprocity to carry firearms in other states. Anyone seeking a pistol license applies through their county sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office can issue a qualified or unlimited license.

You must be an Alabama resident and at least 19 years old to obtain a pistol license. Individuals in U.S. military service (or honorably discharged) or the Alabama National Guard can apply at 18 years old.

Alabama is a “shall issue” state, which means that if you meet the licensing requirements and are not among those prohibited from carrying a gun, the state must issue the license. Other requirements for eligibility of license holders are outlined in the chart below.

Even with broad rights to carry a firearm in public, firearm laws provide restrictions on locations where a person can possess a gun. Gun owners need to avoid carrying a gun in the following locations:

  * Police, sheriff, or highway patrol stations
  * Courthouses and District Attorney offices
  * The primary office of an elected official
  * Meetings of city councils and county commissions
  * The Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery
  * Jails, prisons, and other correctional facilities
  * Facilities for treatment for those with psychiatric, mental, or emotional disorders
  * Schools (prohibits carry with intent to do harm, with exceptions)
  * School-related athletic events
  * At a demonstration in a public place (except law enforcement)
  * Workplaces where firearms are banned by employers (but not employees’ motor vehicles)

There may be location restrictions. Alabama maintains a concealed carry license for reciprocity with other states.

### Open Carried Allowed?

Yes. Open carry is allowed. Handguns must be secured, such as in a holster. The state of Alabama bans the carrying of a rifle or a shotgun walking cane. Again, there may be location restrictions.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

  * Have not otherwise caused justifiable concern for public safety



### Machine Gun Laws

State law does not ban possession of machine guns. Federal law prohibits the possession of most machine guns made after May 19, 1986, outside of the military and law enforcement.

### Gun Violence Prevention Efforts

In 2012, twenty children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in the deadliest elementary school shooting in U.S. history. Since then, efforts to prevent gun violence and enhance gun safety have increased significantly.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Connecticut’s Gun Laws

In 2013, Connecticut enacted an assault weapons ban and limited large-capacity magazines. The state expanded background check regulations and gun permit requirements. The definition of an assault weapon now includes the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle, modeled after the M16. The law also imposes a 10-round limit on magazine capacity. Connecticut’s gun control measures have withstood several legal challenges.

### State Administration

The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) oversees Connecticut gun laws. The Connecticut State Police, Special Licensing and Firearms Unit (SLFU), manages permits for handguns and long guns, regulates all retail and private sales, maintains registries of machine guns and assault weapons, and conducts background checks for purchases and transfers.

### Compliance with Federal and State Laws

All gun purchases and transfers in Connecticut must comply with federal and state law restrictions.

### 2023 Gun Safety Legislation

In 2023, Governor Ned Lamont signed new legislation to strengthen gun safety regulations. The law bans open carry in most situations and raises the minimum age to purchase certain semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21, aligning with handgun requirements.

The sale of ghost gun assembly kits, which allow individuals to assemble untraceable firearms without serial numbers, is banned. Sellers of pistols must provide a trigger lock or similar device, and gun owners are required to safely store firearms unless they are in immediate possession.

### Gun Dealer Requirements

Anyone selling ten or more firearms in a calendar year is considered a gun dealer. Along with federally licensed dealers, they must obtain a state permit for sales from their local police chief or another executive officer.

### Relevant Statutes

  * Certain semi-automatic centerfire rifles, pistols, and shotguns
  * Silencers
  * Bump stocks or other rate of fire enhancers



### Waiting Period

### Ownership Restrictions

You cannot own or possess a firearm if you:

  * Have a felony or violent misdemeanor conviction

### Gun Control and Gun Violence in West Virginia

The issue of gun control and gun violence remains controversial in American politics today. State gun control laws vary greatly. Some states implement strict regulations to enhance gun safety and reduce gun violence, while others favor limited gun laws, presenting law-abiding gun owners as the solution to gun crime. West Virginia strikes a balance in these debates, favoring gun rights.

Understanding firearms law often begins with the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. Many state constitutions do the same. Recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affirm that citizens have an individual right to own guns for self-defense and other lawful purposes, extending this right from the home into the public sphere.

However, this right is not absolute. The Court has articulated a historical test for reviewing whether a state or federal gun regulation overly burdens the right to bear arms.

### Federal Firearms Law

Under federal law, Congress regulates the interstate commerce of firearms. It has established laws to control certain dangerous weapons like machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, and sawed-off rifles. It also mandates federal licensing of gun dealers and sets prohibitions for persons who cannot possess firearms. Through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), it helps keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them, such as convicted felons.

### West Virginia Gun Laws

West Virginia’s license plates carry the state slogan “Wild, Wonderful,” reflecting an emphasis on outdoor adventures. State law favors gun rights for hunting, recreational use, and self-defense. As a result, West Virginia’s firearm laws lack many restrictions found in other states.

For example, no permit is required to purchase firearms, and the state does not mandate firearm registration. There are no state bans on assault weapons, nor is there a waiting period from purchase to delivery of firearms.

State law does not provide for universal background checks. If you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, they will run a NICS check. If you buy a gun through a private sale, there is no requirement for a background check.

In 2016, West Virginia adopted a permitless carry law for those at least 21 years old. Also known as constitutional carry, these laws allow citizens who are not otherwise prohibited from holding a concealed handgun license (CHL) to carry a handgun without a permit.

A CHL only covers the carrying of a pistol or revolver. Citizens can still apply for a concealed carry permit through their county sheriff’s office, often for reciprocity, allowing them to carry concealed handguns in other states.

At 18 years old, a person can apply for a provisional CHL. At 21, a person can get a standard CHL. The application forms are prepared by the Superintendent of the West Virginia State Police. The crime of carrying a concealed handgun without a permit does not apply to those between 18 and 21 who meet certain exceptions:

  * Carrying the handgun on their premises
  * Transporting the handgun after purchase to home, business, or for repair
  * While hunting or traveling to or from hunting
  * Members of organized target shooting clubs
  * Law enforcement officers or officials (including federal law enforcement)
  * Certain corrections officials
  * Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, reserve, or National Guard
  * Nonresidents with a valid concealed carry permit from a state recognized by West Virginia
  * Parole officers



### Prohibited Locations for Firearms

In West Virginia, gun owners must be aware that they may not take a firearm into the following places:

  * Primary and secondary schools
  * The State Capitol Complex in Charleston
  * Private real property where firearms are prohibited by the owner
  * Premises of a court of law
  * Federal government buildings, including secure areas of airports
  * Jails, detention facilities, and state correctional institutions
  * Certain buildings or areas limited by a municipality’s local code



One place where firearms may become more common is on college campuses. In July 2024, the state’s new Campus Self-Defense Act will take effect, allowing those with a valid concealed carry license to bring handguns onto public college and university campuses. The law, supported by the National Rifle Association (NRA), was opposed by the presidents of the state’s five major institutions, including West Virginia University and Marshall University.

### Louisiana Gun Control Laws

Louisiana’s gun control laws are among the least restrictive in the U.S. There is no requirement for a license or permit to own a firearm, and no state restrictions on assault weapons or large-capacity magazines.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Universal Background Checks

Universal background checks are not required for gun purchases. Federal law mandates background checks for purchases through federally licensed dealers, but private sales are exempt.

### State Constitution

Gun control efforts consider the interests of gun owners, as Louisiana is popular for outdoor activities like hunting and fishing. The state constitution affirms: “The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms is fundamental and shall not be infringed. Any restriction on this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.”

The Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that the right to bear arms is not absolute, upholding restrictions on felons and juveniles possessing firearms, as well as the state’s concealed carry law, citing a compelling state interest.

### Waiting Period

There is no waiting period for gun purchases in Louisiana. However, specific requirements exist for obtaining a concealed carry permit. Applicants must be state residents, at least 21 years old, and not prohibited from firearm possession under state or federal law. Louisiana is a “shall issue” state, meaning permits will be issued if criteria are met. The Louisiana State Police provide application details.

### Restrictions on Carrying Firearms

Firearms, whether concealed or open, are restricted in the following locations:

  * Law enforcement offices, stations, or buildings
  * Prisons, jails, or detention facilities
  * Courthouses or courtrooms
  * Public buildings used for governmental meetings
  * The state capitol building
  * Prohibited areas within airport facilities
  * Places of worship, unless authorized
  * Schools, campuses, or buses
  * Polling places
  * Parades or demonstrations with government permits
  * Establishments licensed to sell alcohol
  * Private residences, unless authorized by the resident



Efforts to pass a broad permitless carry law were unsuccessful in 2022. However, permitless carry was approved for active-duty military and veterans who are Louisiana residents (See L.R.S. 14:95 M).

### Preemption Statute

Louisiana law includes a preemption statute that generally prevents cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans from enacting stricter gun laws than those at the state level.

### Relevant Statutes

#### Louisiana Revised Statutes

  * **Title 14, Section 95** : Illegal carrying of weapons
  * **Title 14, Section 95.1** : Possession of a firearm or carrying concealed weapon by a person convicted of certain felonies

### Overview of Gun Laws in Florida

### Federal Firearms Law

While most gun regulations are state-level, federal laws apply nationwide, licensing gun dealers and restricting ownership of certain weapons like machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, and silencers. Federal law also prohibits firearm possession by certain individuals, such as convicted felons and drug users.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Florida Gun Control Laws

Florida’s gun laws are less restrictive compared to many states. The state does not ban assault weapons or limit magazine capacity and does not require a purchase permit or firearm license. However, there is a three-day waiting period between purchasing and receiving a firearm. After the Parkland shooting, additional gun control measures were enacted.

### Stand Your Ground Laws in Florida

In 2005, Florida implemented the nation’s first stand-your-ground law, which became prominent after the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman. The law allows individuals to use force in self-defense without the duty to retreat if they believe it will prevent death, great bodily harm, or a forcible felony. It also provides immunity from criminal prosecution and civil suits when self-defense is claimed.

### The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act

Signed into law on March 9, 2018, following the Parkland shooting, this act made several changes:

  * Banned bump stocks
  * Extended mental health services
  * Introduced a red flag law allowing courts to temporarily remove firearms from those deemed at risk
  * Permitted sheriffs to appoint trained school employees as “guardians” to be armed on school grounds



### Florida Concealed Carry Law

Before 2023, individuals needed to apply for a concealed weapons license, pass a background check, and complete firearms safety training. This process helped prevent unauthorized possession and aided law enforcement.

In 2023, Florida enacted a permitless carry law, allowing eligible individuals to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Despite this, many still apply for the state license to benefit from reciprocity in other states.

### Restrictions on Carrying Firearms

Regardless of license status, firearms are prohibited in certain locations, including:

  * Schools and administration buildings
  * Colleges and universities
  * Places of nuisance (e.g., houses of prostitution)
  * Law enforcement facilities
  * Detention facilities and prisons
  * Courthouses
  * Polling places
  * Government and legislative meetings
  * School and professional athletic events
  * Career centers
  * Portions of bars serving alcohol
  * Airports
  * Hospitals providing mental health services
  * Federally prohibited locations



Exceptions may apply for law enforcement or designated security officers in specific situations.

### Gun Violence Challenges Faced by Governments

Both state and federal governments face challenges in addressing crime, including gun violence. One of the most tragic mass shootings in the U.S. occurred in 2015 at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. A 21-year-old self-proclaimed white supremacist fatally shot nine church members during a Bible study session, intending to commit a hate crime.

In the aftermath of such tragedies, lawmakers in some states reevaluate their gun laws, seeking consensus on measures to prevent future gun crimes. Balancing public safety with the rights of gun owners presents a complex task.

### Federal Firearms Regulations

Despite occasional proposals, changes to federal gun laws have been infrequent. State-level responses vary based on political landscapes, sometimes resulting in compromises on gun safety initiatives rather than comprehensive legislative reforms.

Federal laws regulate the ownership and use of certain dangerous weapons, such as machine guns and accessories like bump stocks that simulate fully automatic firing in semi-automatic rifles. Firearms dealers must be licensed by the federal government, and possession is prohibited for categories including felons and illegal drug users.

### South Carolina Gun Laws Overview

States have the authority to enact gun control laws that restrict the purchase, possession, and use of firearms. Generally, South Carolina lawmakers prioritize gun rights over regulations, citing the Second Amendment’s protection of the right to bear arms as a fundamental limitation on legislative restrictions.

Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have reinforced the individual right to own guns for lawful purposes, prompting increased challenges to state and federal gun regulations by advocates of Second Amendment rights.

### South Carolina Specifics

South Carolina does not mandate a permit or license for purchasing or owning firearms, nor does it enforce waiting periods for prospective buyers. However, certain restrictions on gun possession are in place.

Historically, South Carolina required a concealed weapons permit (CWP) for carrying concealed firearms in most situations. Exceptions included carrying firearms on personal property, at workplaces, or during hunting activities.

In 2024, the state legislature is considering legislation to eliminate this requirement, potentially allowing individuals to carry concealed handguns without a permit or background check if passed. Such “permitless carry” laws, also known as constitutional carry laws, operate on the assumption that citizens understand when firearm possession is legally restricted. States that adopt permitless carry laws typically retain their permit systems to facilitate reciprocity with other states.

Residents or property owners in South Carolina can apply for a CWP through the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). South Carolina operates as a “shall issue” state, obligating authorities to issue a CWP to applicants meeting objective criteria such as age, firearms training, and absence of disqualifying factors. Even with a CWP, individuals must comply with state laws that designate locations where firearms are prohibited.

### Key Provisions of South Carolina Gun Control Laws

**Relevant Statutes:** South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 16, Chapter 23; Title 23, Chapter 31.  
**Illegal Firearms:** Prohibited firearms under state law include machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, sawed-off rifles, and military firearms. Additional prohibitions cover teflon-coated ammunition and handguns with altered serial numbers.  
**Waiting Period:** None for firearm purchases.  
**Prohibited Ownership:** Individuals barred from handgun ownership under state law include those convicted of violent crimes, fugitives, habitual drinkers, drug addicts, and those deemed mentally incompetent.

South Carolina does not mandate firearm licenses for ownership, but a concealed carry permit is required for carrying concealed weapons. Open carry is limited to individuals with a CWP.

### Eligibility for Concealed Carry License

Applicants must be South Carolina residents or non-resident property owners aged 21 or older. They must pass a criminal background check, submit fingerprints, and provide proof of firearms training.

### U.S. Supreme Court’s Role

Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, such as New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), emphasize individual rights to gun ownership, overturning state laws that impose strict criteria for concealed carry permits unless based on objective standards.

### Idaho Gun Laws Overview

### Federal and State Laws

Federal firearms laws apply universally, prohibiting certain firearms like post-1986 machine guns except for specific entities. States like Idaho can impose additional restrictions, including permits for purchase and concealed carry licenses.

### Restrictions and Regulations

Idaho law prohibits certain weapons and imposes age restrictions, with no waiting period for firearm purchases. Assault weapons and ghost guns are not banned but must comply with federal guidelines.

### Locations Where Firearms Are Prohibited

Idaho restricts firearms in specific locations, including schools, courthouses, juvenile facilities, and certain public entertainment venues owned by universities.

### Permitless Carry Law

Idaho enacted a permitless carry law in 2016, allowing law-abiding citizens not otherwise prohibited from firearm possession to carry concealed weapons statewide without a permit. Retired law enforcement officers also qualify under this law.

### Concealed Weapons License

While permitless carry is permitted, Idaho offers concealed weapons licenses for reciprocity with other states. Applicants apply through their county sheriff’s office, guided by the Idaho State Police and Attorney General’s resources.

### State Preemption

Idaho maintains state preemption, ensuring uniform firearm regulations across municipalities and counties without stricter local laws.

This overview highlights Idaho’s approach to firearm legislation, balancing individual rights with public safety concerns through comprehensive state and federal regulations.

### Overview of Gun Control Debates in the U.S.

Gun control debates in the U.S. often come down to differing views on the role of firearms in public safety. Both sides claim safety as their main concern, but they take conflicting approaches to achieve it.

Gun rights advocates argue that increasing gun ownership among law-abiding citizens empowers people to deter or confront gun violence. In contrast, supporters of gun violence prevention efforts call for stricter gun laws to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of criminals and those who misuse them.

Wisconsin gun laws aim to balance supporting citizens’ gun rights with maintaining reasonable regulations.

### Supreme Court Rulings and the Second Amendment

In recent rulings, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that the Second Amendment guarantees individuals the right to bear arms for self-defense both at home and in public. This has led to legal challenges to both old and new gun regulations. Keeping up with changes in the law, whether through legislation or court rulings, can be challenging for gun owners and the general public alike.

### Federal Gun Laws

Federal law applies to all 50 states, with most regulations stemming from the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as amended. These laws set up a framework for the legal manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms. Anyone purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer must undergo a criminal background check.

Federal law prevents certain persons from buying, owning, or possessing firearms, including convicted felons, illegal drug users, and those with misdemeanor convictions or restraining orders related to domestic abuse. States can often enact stricter laws in these areas.

### Wisconsin Gun Laws at a Glance

Wisconsin, like all states, complies with federal firearms laws, including those set out in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which amended the GCA. Wisconsin also follows the NFA provisions related to certain dangerous weapons and has its own gun laws.

State gun laws often restrict the types of guns people can own and where they can use them. Some states require universal background checks on all gun sales, but Wisconsin only requires background checks for firearms purchased through dealers.

While some states have permitless carry laws, Wisconsin does not. However, it allows gun owners to carry firearms on their person without a permit at their homes, businesses, and on their land.

In most cases, Wisconsin requires individuals to be 18 years old or older to possess a firearm, with exceptions for military personnel, minors engaged in supervised target practice, and hunting.

### Open and Concealed Carry in Wisconsin

Wisconsin allows open carry of firearms by those not prohibited from possessing them. State law also prevents charges of disorderly conduct under a local ordinance for loading, carrying, or going armed with a firearm, unless there is other evidence of criminal intent.

Wisconsin requires a state license for the concealed carry of firearms in public. The law defines a weapon as a handgun, electric weapon (taser), or billy club. To obtain a concealed carry weapon (CCW) license, you must apply to the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ).

State licenses are only issued to Wisconsin residents and active-duty members of the armed forces who reside in Wisconsin. The DOJ provides a helpful website with a FAQ section on the application process, reciprocity with other states, and more.

### Prohibited Locations for Firearms in Wisconsin

Whether you open carry or conceal carry, avoid taking a firearm to these locations:

  * Police station, sheriff’s office, state patrol station, or DOJ special agent office
  * Prisons, jails, correctional facilities
  * Certain mental health facilities
  * Wisconsin Resource Center
  * County, state, or federal courthouses
  * Municipal courtrooms if court is in session
  * Any part of an airport past the security checkpoint
  * Your job, if the employer prohibits firearms
  * Private property or businesses if the owner prohibits firearms



Certain places that ban firearms provide exceptions for those with a valid CCW permit, including:

  * State wildlife refuges
  * State fish hatcheries
  * Buildings owned or leased by the state or a political subdivision like a city or county
  * Taverns, hotels, and restaurants unless the CCW permit holder consumes alcoholic beverages in these locations

### Overview of Federal and State Gun Control Laws

Both state and federal laws play crucial roles in regulating firearms and ammunition, covering aspects from manufacture and purchase to possession and use. These laws aim to balance public safety concerns with the constitutional rights of individuals to own and use firearms for lawful purposes like self-defense.

Federal laws oversee firearm manufacturing and licensing for gun dealers, impose restrictions on owning dangerous weapons, and identify categories of individuals prohibited from possessing firearms, such as convicted felons and those convicted of domestic violence.

The enforcement of federal laws is carried out by agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established by Congress to aid law enforcement agencies in preventing firearms from falling into the hands of individuals not legally allowed to possess them.

Each state also sets its own regulations on purchasing and using firearms under its jurisdiction. These laws must align with the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, safeguarding the right to bear arms for lawful purposes.

### Oklahoma Gun Laws Overview

Oklahoma is known for its favorable stance on gun ownership, with laws designed to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to possess and carry firearms. The state has refrained from introducing new gun control measures in response to rising firearm violence, instead expanding gun rights in recent years.

In Oklahoma, there is no requirement for a license or permit to purchase a firearm, and no waiting period is mandated following a purchase. Purchases from licensed dealers require a federal criminal background check, but private transactions do not necessitate such checks.

While assault weapons are not banned, Oklahoma prohibits certain dangerous weapons and ammunition. For instance, state law prohibits possession of sawed-off shotguns or rifles unless registered under federal law. It also prohibits using restricted bullets designed to penetrate body armor, imposing additional penalties for wearing body armor during the commission of a crime.

State law restricts firearm possession for convicted felons, individuals illegally present in the U.S., those under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and those adjudicated mentally incompetent. Minors under 18 years old generally cannot possess firearms unless participating in specified activities under adult supervision.

### Oklahoma Carry Laws

Oklahoma has enacted laws that ease restrictions on both concealed and open carry of firearms in recent years.

In 2019, Oklahoma implemented permitless carry legislation, allowing individuals aged 21 and older (or 18–20 if in the military) to carry firearms openly or concealed without needing a background check or handgun license. However, these individuals must comply with all applicable state and federal laws; otherwise, they risk arrest and prosecution.

Despite permitless carry, individuals may still apply for a concealed handgun license for reciprocity purposes with other states. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) oversees the application process, which includes demonstrating residency and completing firearm safety training approved by the Oklahoma Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training (CLEET).

Exceptions for carrying firearms exist for law enforcement officers, as well as for self-defense, hunting, educational purposes, and certain recreational activities.

### Prohibited Locations

Despite relaxed firearm carry laws, Oklahoma prohibits firearms in specific locations, including government buildings open to the public, courthouses, prisons, schools, colleges, and venues where alcohol sales are primary. Exceptions exist for authorized personnel and specific circumstances.

### Overview of Oklahoma Gun Control Laws

Similar to other states, Oklahoma has implemented a preemption law preventing local municipalities like Oklahoma City from passing gun control ordinances conflicting with state law.

Below is a summary of key Oklahoma gun laws:

### Federal and State Gun Control Laws

While some firearms regulations originate from federal mandates, the responsibility for enacting and enforcing gun control laws primarily falls on individual states. These laws often vary significantly from state to state, reflecting local customs and attitudes toward firearms. Requirements for purchasing and carrying guns can range widely, with some states imposing strict permitting processes and waiting periods, while others maintain fewer restrictions.

### Guns and State Laws in America

Guns are a hot-button issue in America. State gun laws reflect the vast difference in attitudes toward gun ownership and gun violence from one region to the next. Many states require a waiting period upon the purchase of a firearm and have several restrictions on the carrying of handguns. Arkansas gun laws are more permissive than many other states.

Gun owners point to the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as the basis for limited regulation of firearms. It protects the right to bear arms. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has called the right to own guns an individual right for self-defense at home and in public. The Court has also stated that gun rights are not absolute. The government may place reasonable restrictions on firearms and their use. The Court requires a historical test for such regulations, asking whether the firearm restriction is consistent with traditional gun regulations in the U.S.

Federal gun control laws provide for the licensing of gun dealers. They also prohibit certain persons from possessing firearms. This includes convicted felons and users of illegal drugs. Federal law also set up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which assists gun dealers and law enforcement agencies.

### The Basics of Arkansas Gun Control Laws

Arkansas law prohibits some weapons that are banned in other states, such as machine guns and defaced firearms. Other than that, Arkansas has very few controls on gun ownership. There is no waiting period to purchase a firearm, including handguns. The state does not require a permit to buy handguns. Arkansas does not require universal background checks for gun purchases. If you buy a gun from a licensed dealer, they will comply with federal law and run a background check before delivery of the weapon. If you buy a gun through a private sale, there is no background check requirement.

In recent years, the number of mass shootings has led to new public safety efforts in several states. This has led to restrictions on ownership of assault-style weapons and undetectable guns which may be created through 3-D printing or built from mail-order gun kits. Several states have also adopted so-called red flag laws that allow courts to prohibit the possession of firearms by persons who are a threat to themselves or others.

Arkansas has not joined such efforts. In contrast, the state has loosened regulations on the carrying of concealed firearms. It enacted a permitless concealed carry law. Under permitless carry, an otherwise law-abiding citizen can carry a concealed handgun without first getting a state permit and passing a background check. Due to confusion over when a concealed carry permit is required, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 777. It clarified that the purpose and construction of the concealed handguns subchapter of the Arkansas Code was to assist residents with reciprocity with other states. Arkansas law does not require a person to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun in the state.

Arkansas offers the option of regular and enhanced permits. An enhanced permit requires a separate firearms safety training certificate. It may allow a permit holder to take a concealed firearm into certain places that are otherwise prohibited. This includes public colleges and most public buildings. More information appears on the Arkansas State Police website.

In Arkansas, there is no minimum age for owning a rifle or shotgun. However, the law prohibits most people under 18 years old from possessing a handgun. There are exceptions for minors under parental or other adult supervision who are participating in lawful marksmanship competitions, practices, or other lawful recreational shooting.

### Location Restrictions

As with other states, Arkansas prohibits bringing firearms into certain places. Location restrictions come with several exceptions. In general, you cannot have a gun in the following locations:

  * Public or private schools (K-12)
  * School buses and bus stops
  * Colleges and universities and their events
  * Public buildings at the State Capitol, including the Arkansas Justice building in Little Rock
  * Police, sheriff, state police stations
  * Detention facilities, jails, prisons
  * Any meeting place of the governing body of a governmental unit
  * Any meeting of the General Assembly or one of its committees
  * Any state office
  * Athletic events not related to firearms
  * Churches and other places of worship
  * Parades or demonstrations that require a permit
  * Passenger terminal of an airport
  * Certain places licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages
  * Private property when notice is provided



Law enforcement officers are permitted to carry a weapon in a number of these locations.

### Illegal Arms

The following arms are illegal to own in Arkansas:

  * Bombs
  * Machine guns
  * Metal (“brass”) knuckles
  * Defaced firearms (removed or altered serial marks or ID numbers)



### Waiting Period

There is no waiting period to purchase a firearm in Arkansas.

### Who May Not Own Firearms

The following persons are prohibited from owning a firearm:

  * People with a felony conviction
  * People who are adjudicated mentally ill
  * People who are committed involuntarily to any mental institution



The Governor can restore gun rights in certain limited circumstances.

### License Required?

No. You don’t need a license to purchase or own a gun in Arkansas.

### Concealed Carry License Required?

No. A state concealed handgun carry license (CHCL) is optional. At 18 years old, a person can carry a concealed handgun in the state if they are otherwise engaged in lawful activity and under no prohibition. The state provides a CHCL for citizens who desire to have reciprocity in other states.

### Open Carry Allowed?

Yes. Open carry is allowed in Arkansas unless there is an unlawful intent to use the firearm against a person.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

To be eligible for a concealed handgun carry license (CHCL), you must:

  * Be 21 years of age or older, or at least 18 years of age if a member of the armed forces, National Guard, or reserve
  * Be a United States citizen or a permanent resident
  * Have resided in Arkansas continuously for at least 90 days prior to the application
  * Desire a legal means to carry a firearm to defend yourself
  * Not be convicted of a felony unless you are pardoned or had your records expunged
  * Not suffer from an infirmity that prevents you from safely handling a firearm
  * Have not threatened or attempted suicide
  * Not be prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or federal law and have passed a criminal background check
  * Not chronically or habitually abuse a controlled substance or alcohol to the extent that normal faculties are impaired
  * Not have been committed to a treatment facility for a controlled substance or alcohol abuse or found guilty of an offense under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act within the last three years
  * Not have been adjudicated to be mentally incompetent or been involuntarily committed to a mental health institution or treatment facility
  * Completed the firearm training course
  * Sign a statement of allegiance to the U.S. and Arkansas Constitutions
  * Not be a fugitive from justice



You may apply for a restricted license (live fire training with revolver) or an unrestricted license (live fire training with a semi-automatic handgun). You may also apply for an enhanced CHCL. It requires separate training. An application for any CHCL may be denied if you have been found guilty of a misdemeanor crime of violence or an offense of carrying a weapon within the past five years. Arkansas recognizes all out-of-state concealed carry licenses.

### Overview of Gun Control Laws

Gun control laws remain a controversial topic in the United States. Gun owners point to the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. Both state and federal governments struggle with the need to balance gun rights with the public’s right to be free of gun violence.

Gun laws identify what types of guns should be illegal, if any, and what conduct or behavior by a person can cause them to lose the right to possess or own firearms.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Gun Laws

Any understanding of federal gun laws begins with the Second Amendment, which states, “a well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.”

In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to provide an individual’s right to keep and carry guns for self-defense and other lawful reasons. This view of a constitutional right to arms has led to closer scrutiny of state and federal firearms regulation.

Key federal gun laws derive from Congress’s ability to regulate interstate commerce in firearms. In 1934, Congress passed the National Firearms Act (NFA) to regulate and tax manufacturers, owners, and purchasers of certain dangerous weapons used by organized crime.

In 1968, Congress updated the NFA when it passed the Gun Control Act. It expanded its licensing of firearms dealers and categories of those who were prohibited from possessing guns. It later set up the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.

If you purchase a firearm from a licensed federal dealer, the gun won’t be delivered until the completion of a criminal background check that shows that the purchaser is not in a prohibited category.

### Mississippi Gun Laws

### Background Check Loophole

Mississippi law does not close the background check loophole. State law does not require that private sales and transfers of firearms occur via a licensed dealer with a background check.

### Waiting Period and Weapon Restrictions

Unlike some other states, there is no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and when delivery takes place. Mississippi does not ban assault weapons or large-capacity magazines of ammunition.

### Age Restrictions

There is no minimum age to own or possess a rifle or shotgun. You must be at least 18 years old to own or possess a handgun under most circumstances.

### Permitless Carry Law

In 2016, the state adopted a permitless carry law. This law allows a person 21 years of age or older to carry a concealed pistol, revolver, or stun gun on their person without first obtaining a permit and passing a background check as long as they are not prohibited under state or federal law.

### Concealed Carry Definitions

In Mississippi, concealed means hidden or obscured from common observation. If a person carries a handgun in a sheath, belt holster, shoulder holster, or case that is partially visible, the law does not view that as concealed.

### Carrying a Firearm Without a Permit

You also do not need a license or permit to carry a firearm on your person at your dwelling, place of business, or in your motor vehicle.

### Concealed/Enhanced Carry Permits

The Mississippi Department of Public Safety maintains a concealed/enhanced carry permit process for those permit-holders who seek reciprocity to carry a concealed handgun in another state. Applicants must pass a criminal background check, provide their fingerprints, and pay a license fee.

Enhanced permit holders must complete an approved firearms training course. Those with an enhanced permit can also carry concealed in certain areas where firearms are prohibited for the general public.

### Exemptions

Members of the Armed Forces, active law enforcement, and honorably retired law enforcement officers are granted an exemption from the permit law. Mississippi is a shall-issue state, meaning that if you meet the objective criteria and pass a background check, the state must issue the permit.

### Restricted Locations for Firearms

Certain locations remain off-limits for firearms in the state. These include:

  * A place of nuisance (where more than one act of lewdness, prostitution, or illegal drug activity occurs)
  * A police, sheriff, or highway patrol station
  * Prisons, jails, detention facilities
  * Courthouse or courtroom except for the judge or persons authorized by the judge
  * Polling places
  * Meeting places of a governing body, including the Legislature and its committees
  * School and college facilities, unless they are used for authorized firearm-related activity
  * School, college, or professional athletic events not related to firearms
  * Parts of establishments that are primarily involved with dispensing alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises
  * Passenger terminal of an airport
  * Designated facilities for those with intellectual disability or illness
  * Churches and other places of worship
  * Places where the entity or person in charge has placed written notice that carrying a pistol or revolver is prohibited
  * Parades or demonstrations that require a permit
  * Locations where firearms are prohibited under federal law



### Enhanced Concealed Carry Permits

However, those holding an enhanced concealed carry permit may carry a firearm in all the above locations, with a few exceptions. Enhanced permit holders cannot carry in:

  * A courtroom during a judicial proceeding or as otherwise prohibited by the judge
  * A place of nuisance
  * A police, highway patrol, or sheriff’s station
  * A detention facility, prison, or jail
  * A privately owned place where the owner or person in charge bans firearms



### Preemption Law

Mississippi has also enacted a preemption law that prevents counties and cities from passing ordinances stricter than state laws regulating possession, carrying, transportation, sale, transfer, or ownership of firearms, ammunition, or their components.

This law has exemptions that allow local governments to regulate the discharge of firearms in city or county limits and the carrying of firearms in public parks, riots, political rallies, parades, and other situations.

### Maryland Gun Control Laws

Gun control laws in the U.S. are controversial, balancing public safety and individual rights. Maryland has stricter gun laws compared to many states, including an assault weapons ban passed in 2013 after the Sandy Hook shooting.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Maryland Gun Control Laws

Maryland’s comprehensive gun regulations address the purchase, possession, use, and carry of firearms. The laws restrict who can own guns and ban certain firearms and accessories. Individuals under 21 cannot possess a handgun or assault weapon, and those under 18 cannot purchase long guns or ammunition. Convicted felons and those deemed mentally incompetent are also prohibited from possessing firearms.

In 2018, Maryland enacted a red flag law, allowing courts to remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat by law enforcement or family members.

### Maryland Permit Laws

To purchase a handgun or assault weapon, individuals must be at least 21 and complete a firearms safety course, obtaining a Handgun Qualification License (HQL). The Maryland State Police oversee the permit process, requiring background checks for all transactions, including private sales. Gun dealers must be licensed.

Carrying a handgun, either concealed or open, requires a permit, limited to those 21 and older. Without a permit, carrying is restricted to personal residences, owned land, or places of business.

### Location Prohibitions

Maryland law prohibits firearms in:

  * Areas for children and vulnerable adults (schools, preschools)
  * Public infrastructure and government buildings (government, university buildings, polling locations)
  * Special areas (stadiums, museums, amusement parks, racetracks, establishments serving alcohol or cannabis)
  * Private property open to the public without explicit permission
  * Public demonstrations or within 1,000 feet of them when law enforcement has provided notice



### Preemption Law

Maryland state law generally preempts local firearm regulations, but exceptions exist. Local governments can regulate firearm use involving minors and non-range shooting discharges. Cities like Baltimore and Annapolis can regulate gun-related activities near public areas such as parks, schools, and churches.

### Arizona Gun Control Laws

Arizona gun control laws are among the least restrictive in the United States. In 2010, Arizona was one of the first states to enact a permitless or constitutional carry law. As a result, Arizona allows any person 21 years or older who is not a prohibited possessor to carry a firearm openly or concealed without the need for a concealed weapons permit.

Arizona, like other states, has struggled to prevent mass shootings and gun violence. In 2011, an armed man appeared at a public event at a Tucson area Safeway store parking lot. He shot Gabrielle Giffords, a member of Congress who represented Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, along with 18 others. Six of the victims, including a federal court judge, died from their injuries. Giffords recovered from a gunshot wound to her head after surgery and months of therapy. She later left Congress and founded the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Although lawmakers spoke out against the assassination attempt and loss of life, it did not lead to changes in Arizona gun laws.

### Federal Firearms Law

Both federal and state laws address the possession, carrying, and use of firearms. Federal law regulates the ownership and use of certain dangerous weapons, including machine guns and devices like bump stocks, which cause a semi-automatic rifle to fire like a fully automatic weapon. The federal government also licenses firearms dealers and bans the possession of firearms by certain persons like convicted felons and those using illegal drugs. Efforts by both the federal and state governments to regulate firearms must comply with the Second Amendment rights of gun owners to bear arms for lawful purposes such as self-defense.

In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court held gun laws that burden the right to bear arms must be consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation. Gun rights advocates have filed new challenges to many federal and state gun regulations, citing the new historical test from Bruen.

### Arizona Gun Laws

In Arizona, the state constitution also protects the right to bear arms. Firearm laws continue to reflect the state’s permissive approach to gun regulation. Arizona does not ban assault weapons. The state has no waiting period or licensing process for the purchase of a firearm. It does not require private gun sales or transfers to include a criminal background check.

### Concealed Carry Laws

States like Arizona that have permitless handgun carry laws operate on the honor system. They presume that citizens know when the law prohibits them from having a firearm and will comply. Such laws have replaced prior concealed carry permit laws that required a person to pass a criminal background check and complete a firearms safety training course before they received permission to carry a concealed firearm.

Even though Arizona is a permitless carry state, it maintains its concealed carry weapons (CCW) permit process for purposes of reciprocity with other states. For that reason, many individuals still seek the issuance of CCW permits. The Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) accepts applications for such permits. Arizona is a “shall issue” state, which means that the DPS must issue a permit to individuals who meet the objective criteria outlined in the statute. You can apply online or by mailing the application packet to the DPS in Phoenix.

### Location Restrictions

Arizona law prohibits taking firearms into the following locations:

  * Polling places on election day
  * School grounds
  * Commercial nuclear hydroelectric generating stations
  * Military installations
  * Correctional facilities
  * Game preserves
  * National parks
  * Federal buildings
  * Airports (secure locations)
  * Where federal, state, or local laws prohibit weapons
  * On private property or in businesses where the owner or establishment has posted signs prohibiting weapons or asked you to remove them
  * At a public establishment or public event after a reasonable request by the operator to remove the weapon and place it in temporary storage



There are often exceptions for peace officers and others authorized by the owner or business. To know if you may qualify for an exception, check the website or call an official in advance for clarification.

### Illegal Arms

The following firearms are illegal to own in Arizona:

  * Automatic weapons (firearm capable of shooting one or more shots automatically without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger)
  * Rifles with barrels less than 16 inches
  * Shotguns with barrels less than 18 inches
  * Any firearm made from a rifle or shotgun that has been modified to a length of less than 26 inches
  * Devices made or adapted to muffle the report of a firearm
  * Defaced deadly weapons



### Waiting Period

There is no waiting period to purchase a firearm in Arizona.

### Who May Not Own or Possess Firearms

The following persons can’t own or possess a firearm:

  * Anyone with a felony conviction or an adjudication of delinquency for a felony, unless their civil rights have been restored
  * Anyone who, at the time of possession, is serving a term of probation, parole, or community supervision for a domestic violence conviction or a felony offense
  * Anyone found to constitute a danger to themselves or others or to have a persistent or acute disability or grave disability pursuant to a court order and whose rights to possess a firearm have not been restored
  * Anyone who has been found incompetent or “guilty except insane”

### Gun Control in North Carolina

The topic of gun control remains contentious, whether at the state legislature or in Congress. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and provisions in most state constitutions protect citizens’ rights to own and bear arms. Gun violence challenges both state and federal governments to find effective ways to ensure public safety.

North Carolina’s gun control laws aim to balance the rights of gun owners with the state’s obligation to protect its residents. To some observers, North Carolina’s laws are perceived as permissive. The state does not impose regulations on or restrict access to assault weapons. In 2023, North Carolina repealed its pistol purchase permit law.

### Federal Firearms Law

While states largely regulate guns, several critical federal laws apply nationwide. Federal law governs the ownership and registration of certain firearms and accessories such as machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, sawed-off rifles, and silencers. It also mandates licensing requirements for firearms dealers.

Federal law prohibits gun possession by individuals convicted of felonies or misdemeanor domestic violence. These federal restrictions underpin the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), used by federally licensed firearms dealers and most law enforcement agencies to prevent firearms from reaching prohibited individuals.

### North Carolina Gun Control Laws

State laws often go beyond federal laws in regulating firearms. They can restrict the sale, purchase, use, and carrying of guns based on state-specific political and ideological beliefs. While all states have some gun restrictions, North Carolina’s laws are considered less restrictive compared to many others.

### Background Checks on Gun Purchases

There has been national momentum to implement universal background checks for gun purchases in several states. Anyone purchasing a firearm through a federally licensed dealer must pass a background check before taking possession. However, federal law does not cover private sales and transfers of firearms.

North Carolina had previously closed the background check loophole for handgun purchases with a requirement to obtain a permit. Despite national support for universal background checks, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation to repeal the state’s pistol purchase permit law, overriding Governor Roy Cooper’s veto.

### License and Carry Laws

In general, North Carolina law prohibits the concealed carry of firearms, with exceptions for active-duty military personnel, certain law enforcement officers, and government officials.

North Carolina issues concealed carry permits (CHP) for those wishing to carry a concealed handgun in public. Applicants must apply at their local sheriff’s office and undergo a criminal background check before receiving a permit. The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association provides guidance on the application process.

Whether or not you have a CHP, it is illegal to consume alcohol or be under the influence of drugs while carrying a firearm. Certain locations, such as schools, courthouses, and places where alcohol is sold and consumed, are off-limits for firearms.

### Overview of Gun Control Issues

Gun control remains a contentious issue in the news. On one side, there is the right for citizens to bear arms for self-defense, while on the other, there is concern for public safety due to mass shootings. Federal gun laws have seen little change, leaving states like Minnesota to find a balance through their own legislation.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Federal Law

Federal law on gun control begins with the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states:

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.”

In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to possess a gun for self-defense. More recently, in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), the Court extended this right to carrying firearms in public. These rulings have significant implications for state regulations, which must align with the historical framework for firearms regulation in the U.S.

The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) regulates interstate commerce in firearms, requiring manufacturers, sellers, and importers to obtain a federal firearms license. It also bans ownership of machine guns and sets forth categories of persons prohibited from firearm possession, such as felons and those convicted of domestic violence. The Brady Act amendments established the National Background Check System (NICS) and a minimum waiting period for background checks.

### State Law

Federal law provides a baseline for firearm regulation, with states often adding further regulations. These may include waiting periods, registration requirements, concealed carry permits, and additional prohibitions on firearm possession.

### Minnesota Gun Control Laws

### Firearm Registration

Minnesota does not require firearm registration. Traditional rifles and shotguns can be purchased without a permit, but a handgun purchase requires a valid permit, including a background check. Purchase or transfer of pistols or semi-automatic military-style assault weapons also requires a permit.

### Permits and Background Checks

Applicants for a gun permit in Minnesota must undergo a criminal background check through the Minnesota Crime Information System and NICS. Permits can be obtained from local police chiefs or county sheriffs.

A permit is also required to carry a gun in public. Minnesota is a “shall issue” state, meaning permits are issued based on objective criteria without discretionary denial by officials.

### Specific Situations and Exceptions

A permit is not required to:

  * Keep or carry a firearm at home, business, or land under one’s control
  * Transport a pistol from the purchase point to home, business, or for repairs
  * Carry a pistol between home and business
  * Carry a pistol for hunting or target shooting in designated areas
  * Transport a pistol in a motor vehicle, snowmobile, or boat if unloaded and secured



Minnesota law prohibits firearms on school property, including campuses, school buses, and childcare centers when children are present. It also has a state preemption law preventing local governments from enacting conflicting firearm regulations.

### Relevant Statutes

Minnesota’s gun control laws can be found in the following statutes:

  * Section 609.66: Dangerous Weapons; Prohibition on firearms on school property
  * Section 609.67: Machine Guns and Short-Barreled Shotguns

  * Short-barreled shotguns
  * Trigger activators
  * Spring guns
  * Saturday Night Special pistols

### Prohibited Possessors

Those prohibited from possessing firearms include:

  * Minors (with limited exceptions)
  * Persons under extreme risk protection orders (red flag law)

  * Persons dishonorably discharged from the military

  * Open carry allowed with a valid carry permit



### Penalties

### Maine Gun Control Laws

### Constitutional Rights

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms. Maine’s constitution echoes this, stating that “every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms, and this right shall never be questioned.” However, this right is not without limitations, balancing public safety and gun ownership rights.

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Recent Events and Legislative Response

On October 25, 2023, a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, highlighted the state’s gun laws. The shooter, an Army reservist, killed 18 people and injured 13 others before being found dead. This tragedy prompted Maine’s governor to urge the legislature to consider tightening gun restrictions, especially concerning background checks and mental health assessments. The potential for new legislation remains uncertain, as lawmakers debate the effectiveness of proposed changes.

### Federal and State Laws

Federal laws, such as the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), establish regulations for firearm manufacture, use, sale, and possession. The NFA regulates certain weapons and requires registration, while the GCA bars specific individuals from firearm ownership, including those with felony convictions and domestic violence misdemeanors. Background checks are mandatory for purchases from federally licensed dealers to prevent illegal ownership.

### Maine’s Gun Laws

Maine’s laws emphasize gun ownership and safety, particularly for hunting and recreational shooting. Advocates for gun control encourage the state to implement universal background checks and consider bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

In 2015, Maine introduced a “permitless carry” law, allowing individuals 21 and older who can legally possess a firearm to carry it concealed without a permit. While this law is seen as a potential risk by some, Maine maintains a concealed carry permit system for reciprocity with other states, administered by the Maine State Police, local police chiefs, or sheriffs.

### Preemption and Local Regulations

Maine’s preemption statute restricts local municipalities from enacting their own firearms regulations, with the exception of controlling the discharge of firearms within their areas.

### Firearms in Vehicles and Workplace Policies

Individuals over 21 who are not prohibited from owning firearms may have them in motor vehicles. Exceptions exist for those 18–20 years old serving in the military, National Guard, or law enforcement. Employers cannot prevent employees with concealed carry permits from storing firearms in their locked vehicles, provided the firearms are not visible.

### Restricted Locations

Carrying firearms is prohibited in specific locations, including:

  * Courthouses
  * Schools
  * Federal buildings
  * State capitol grounds and buildings in Augusta
  * Establishments serving liquor for on-premises consumption
  * Correctional facilities and jails
  * Acadia National Park and state parks
  * Private premises where prohibited by the owner
  * Labor disputes and strikes



### Firearm Safety Requirements

While Maine does not require a firearm permit, dealers must provide a firearm safety brochure with each sale and offer information on local safety programs. They are also required to demonstrate the use of trigger-locking devices to buyers.

### Relevant Statutes

#### Maine Revised Statutes (MRS)

  * **Title 15, Section 393** : Possession of firearms by prohibited persons
  * **Title 17A, Section 554A** : Unlawful transfer of firearm other than a handgun to a minor
  * **Title 17A, Section 554B** : Unlawful transfer of a handgun to a minor
  * **Title 17A, Section 1051** : Possession of machine gun
  * **Title 17A, Section 1056** : Possession of armor-piercing ammunition
  * **Title 17A, Section 1057** : Possession of firearms in an establishment licensed for on-premises consumption of liquor
  * **Title 17A, Section 1058** : Unauthorized possession of a firearm in a courthouse
  * **Title 17A, Section 1059** : Unauthorized possession of a firearm in a correctional facility or jail
  * **Title 20A, Section 6552** : Firearms in schools (with exceptions)
  * **Title 20A, Section 10009** : Public safety on college and university campuses
  * **Title 25, Section 2003** : Permits to carry concealed handguns
  * **Title 25, Section 2012** : Sale of firearms to include safety brochure

### Overview of Iowa Gun Control Laws

Iowa’s approach to gun control reflects a balancing act between Second Amendment rights and public safety concerns.

### Federal and State Gun Control Framework

The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 establishes baseline regulations, including background checks via the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and prohibitions on firearm possession by certain individuals.

### Iowa Gun Laws

Iowa recently enacted laws, including a “permitless carry” provision, making the permit application for firearm acquisition optional. This allows individuals to carry loaded firearms openly or concealed in public, with exceptions in certain places such as schools, parks, and federal facilities.

#### Firearms Restrictions in Iowa

Under Iowa law and federal regulations:

  * Firearms are prohibited within 1,000 feet of schools and parks.
  * Prohibitions also extend to locations like school buses, casinos, and federal facilities such as post offices and courthouses.



#### Legal Developments and Second Amendment Rights

Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), Iowa reaffirmed the individual right to bear arms. The state’s constitutional amendment in 2022 underscores this fundamental right subject to strict scrutiny.

### Permitting Process and Requirements

Iowa’s Department of Public Safety manages the permitting process, facilitating reciprocity with other states:

  * Available permits include those for acquiring pistols or revolvers, nonprofessional carry weapons, and professional carry weapons.
  * Requirements include age thresholds and training mandates, ensuring proficiency and safety among permit holders.



### Age and Ownership Restrictions

In Iowa:

  * Individuals must be 18 years old to purchase long guns and 21 years old for handguns, with exceptions for certain professions.
  * Possession of prohibited firearms like machine guns is restricted to law enforcement and military personnel.



### Compliance with Federal Law

Iowa aligns its firearm regulations with federal standards, prohibiting possession of items such as firearm suppressors and short-barreled shotguns unless compliant with federal law.

### Conclusion

Iowa’s gun control laws reflect a blend of federal mandates and state-specific regulations aimed at safeguarding public safety while respecting constitutional rights. The state continues to adapt its policies in response to legal developments and societal needs.

### Strengthening Gun Control in Delaware

### Recent Legislation

In recent years, Delaware officials have strengthened gun control laws. In 2022 and 2023, Governor John Carney signed legislation that:

  * Bans the sale of assault weapons
  * Raises the age to purchase most firearms to 21
  * Enhances background checks for firearm purchases and transfers
  * Limits high-capacity magazines
  * Removes immunity for the gun industry from lawsuits based on reckless or negligent conduct
  * Bans guns near school safe zones and polling locations on election day, with limited exceptions


[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Ongoing Legislative Efforts

Delaware legislators continue to pass new gun safety laws despite legal challenges and court rulings related to Second Amendment rights. Gun owners must navigate both federal and state regulations regarding the purchase, sale, possession, and use of firearms, which vary by state.

### Prohibited Weapons

Delaware law prohibits ownership or possession of certain weapons, such as sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and silencers. Assault weapons are defined as assault long guns, assault pistols, or copycat weapons, with specific firearms listed in the statute. Exceptions exist for military members, law enforcement, and retired officers.

### Background Checks and Waiting Periods

There is no waiting period for gun buyers in Delaware, but near-universal background checks are required for purchases and transfers. Unlicensed sellers must work with licensed dealers to facilitate these checks, and purchases may be denied if the buyer fails the background check due to factors such as felony convictions, certain misdemeanors, mental health commitments, or protective orders.

### Concealed Carry Regulations

To carry concealed firearms, individuals must obtain a license from the Delaware Superior Court, with input from the Attorney General’s Office. This regulatory framework remains in place following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022), which invalidated New York’s discretionary permit system.

### Open Carry and Constitutional Rights

Delaware does not generally ban open carry, except in limited situations. The state constitution affirms the right to bear arms for self-defense, hunting, and recreational use. The Delaware Supreme Court has upheld the public carry right for self-defense, ruling that blanket bans in state parks and forests are unconstitutional. However, any regulations must be reasonable and necessary for public safety.

### Relevant Statutes

#### 11 Delaware Code

  * **Section 1444** : Possessing a destructive weapon
  * **Section 1441** : License to carry concealed deadly weapons
  * **Title 11, Section 1445** : Unlawfully dealing with a dangerous weapon
  * **Title 11, Section 1448** : Possession and purchase of deadly weapons by persons prohibited
  * **Title 11, Section 1457** : Possession of a weapon in a Safe School and Recreation Zone

  * Firearms adaptable for use as a machine gun
  * Bump stocks, trigger cranks, or rapid-fire devices

### Gun Violence and Gun Control Debates in New Mexico

Gun violence in American cities and mass shootings nationwide continue to spark debates on gun control laws. In 2023, New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham declared a public health emergency in response to escalating gun violence, prompted by several tragic incidents involving children.

Her administration initially imposed restrictions on open and concealed carry in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County through public health orders, which were later adjusted following legal challenges from gun rights advocates. Balancing the rights of gun owners with public safety remains a complex issue amid polarized political climates.

### Federal Laws and Constitutional Rights

Federal law, anchored in the Second Amendment, safeguards citizens’ rights to own firearms for lawful purposes such as self-defense. Recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court affirm gun ownership as an individual right, scrutinizing laws that potentially infringe on this right through historical analysis and alignment with longstanding firearm regulations.

Federal firearm laws oversee interstate commerce, including licensing, taxation, and the lawful manufacture, sale, and possession of specific firearms. Licensed dealers are required to conduct criminal background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), preventing felons, drug users, and others prohibited by law from accessing firearms.

### New Mexico’s Gun Control Laws

Residents of New Mexico must adhere to both federal and state firearm regulations. While the Second Amendment guarantees the right to own firearms, states have authority to enact additional regulations, such as restrictions on firearm purchase, possession, and carrying, as well as bans on certain types of firearms and accessories.

New Mexico’s gun laws are moderate, requiring background checks for private gun sales and a concealed carry permit to carry a concealed loaded handgun.

### Key Regulations in New Mexico

  * **Concealed Carry:** Requires a state-issued license for carrying concealed loaded handguns.
  * **Open Carry:** Permitted with location restrictions.
  * **Red Flag Law:** Allows court orders to prevent individuals deemed dangerous from accessing firearms.
  * **License Requirements:** No license needed for gun ownership; concealed carry requires proof of eligibility and training.
  * **Penalties:** Include felonies for unlawful possession and misdemeanors for offenses like negligent weapon use and firearm sales without background checks.

### Wyoming Gun Control Laws

Wyoming’s approach to gun control laws is characterized by minimal restrictions on gun ownership and purchase, distinguishing it from states with more stringent regulations. Here’s an overview of Wyoming’s gun laws and regulations:

[![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*aCmvRhaa5Xjz4zDZxHzAjg.png)](https://serp.ly/ccw)[👆 Click to get your CCW permit online in just minutes!](https://serp.ly/ccw)

### Overview

Wyoming does not mandate a license, permit, or registration for the purchase or ownership of firearms. The minimum age to purchase a long gun is 18, and for a handgun, it’s 21. The state implemented a permitless carry law in 2011, allowing eligible residents to carry concealed firearms without a permit. In 2021, this law was expanded to include qualified non-residents. However, Wyoming offers a concealed firearms permit (CFP) for residents seeking reciprocity in other states.

### Concealed Carry Permits

Residents can obtain a concealed carry permit from the Wyoming Attorney General’s office upon meeting eligibility criteria, including residency, age, and passing a background check conducted by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI). Wyoming operates as a “shall issue” state, meaning permits are issued if all objective criteria are met. Permits are valid for five years and facilitate exemption from background checks for new firearm purchases from federally licensed dealers.

### Prohibited Locations and Exceptions

Wyoming law prohibits carrying firearms in certain locations, such as law enforcement facilities, courtrooms (except as permitted by the judge), and places where alcohol is sold for on-premises consumption. Firearms are also restricted in school facilities unless authorized by security personnel or for specific educational purposes.

### Additional Regulations

Wyoming does not regulate assault weapons or ghost guns (firearms assembled from kits or 3D printed). There is no mandatory waiting period for firearm purchases, and state preemption laws prevent local authorities from enacting stricter gun regulations than those at the state level.
