#### An overview of the gun laws of Arkansas

Arkansas is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. Concealed weapons licenses are issued at the state level by the Department of Public Safety.

No license, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

Permitless open carry is legal without a license for any person who is at least 18 years old and can legally possess a firearm. On October 17, 2018, the Arkansas Appeals Court ruled in case CR-18‚Äì353 Jamie Taff v. State of Arkansas that the possessor of a handgun must have an unlawful intent to use it as a weapon against a person for possession to be a criminal act. Some areas, including schools and bars, are off-limits.

Concealed carry is legal without a license for anyone over 18 who can legally possess a firearm and is on a journey (outside of their home or property). Concealed Handgun Carry Licenses (CHCL) are issued to residents at least 21 years old or 18 if a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or National Guard, requiring a state-approved firearms training course. Arkansas offers two types of handgun carry licenses: the CHCL and an Enhanced Concealed Carry License (E-CHCL), which allows carrying in some restricted areas such as public colleges, most public buildings, non-secure locations in airports, and churches. The E-CHCL requires about 8 hours of additional classroom and gun-range training. Arkansas does not issue non-resident licenses, but active-duty military and their spouses may apply for an Arkansas CHCL. With permitless carry, anyone who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.

#### Use of Physical Force

A person is justified in using physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to defend themselves or a third person from the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force.

#### Use of Deadly Physical Force in Defense of a Person

A person is justified in using deadly physical force if they reasonably believe the other person is:

  * Committing or about to commit a felony involving physical force or violence
  * Using or about to use unlawful deadly physical force
  * Engaged in a pattern of domestic abuse



A person is not required to retreat before using deadly physical force if they:

  * Are lawfully present at the location where deadly physical force is used
  * Have a reasonable belief that the person against whom deadly physical force is used is imminently threatening to cause death or serious physical injury to themselves or another person
  * Are not the initial aggressor and have not provoked the person against whom deadly physical force is used
  * Are not engaged in criminal activity



#### Defense of Premises

A person in lawful possession or control of premises or a vehicle is justified in using non-deadly physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of a criminal trespass.

A person may use deadly physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent the commission of arson or burglary by a trespasser.

#### Use of Physical Force in Defense of Property

A person is justified in using non-deadly physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent or terminate the commission or attempted commission of theft or criminal mischief or the subsequent flight from the commission or attempted commission of theft or criminal mischief.

#### Self-Defense

The Castle Doctrine in Arkansas states that the right of an individual to defend themselves and their home against harm, injury, or loss by a person unlawfully entering or attempting to enter the home is a fundamental right. As of March 3, 2021, Arkansas has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law, with no duty to retreat before force can be used for self-defense anywhere a person is lawfully allowed to be.
