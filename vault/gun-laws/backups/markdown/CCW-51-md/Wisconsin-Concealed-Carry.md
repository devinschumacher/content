### Summary of Wisconsin Gun Laws

Wisconsin operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry weapons (CCW) licenses, managed by the Department of Justice (DOJ). Here are key aspects of Wisconsin‚Äôs gun laws:

  * **Handgun Purchase Requirements:**
  * No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required for purchasing handguns from private individuals in Wisconsin.
  * **Open Carry Laws:**
  * Individuals aged 18 and older, not prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal laws, can openly carry firearms.

  * **Concealed Carry Laws:**
  * Residents with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License (CWL) and non-residents with valid licenses/permits from states recognized by Wisconsin can carry concealed.
  * CWLs are issued to residents and military personnel stationed in Wisconsin, requiring applicants to be 21 or older and to complete a firearms training course.
  * **Reciprocity:**
  * Wisconsin honors permits from states with reciprocity agreements and those requiring background checks comparable to Wisconsin‚Äôs standards.



### Defense of Property and Self-Defense Laws

  * **Defense of Property:**
  * Individuals may use force to prevent unlawful interference with their property, limited to what is reasonably necessary to stop or prevent the interference.
  * Deadly force solely for defense of property is not considered reasonable.
  * **Self-Defense Laws:**
  * Wisconsin follows the Castle Doctrine, allowing individuals to defend their residence, vehicle, or business without a duty to retreat.
  * Deadly force can only be used if there is a reasonable belief that it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.
  * **Defense of Others:**
  * Individuals can intervene to defend others from unlawful interference under the same conditions as self-defense, assuming the third person would have the right to self-defense.
  * The use of deadly force to protect others is justified when reasonably believed necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.
  * **Presumption in Deadly Force Cases:**
  * If deadly force is used against an intruder in a dwelling, vehicle, or place of business, it is presumed that the force was necessary if certain conditions are met.



These laws are outlined under Wis. Stat. ¬ß¬ß 939.48 & 939.49, defining the parameters of self-defense and property protection in Wisconsin.

**CARRY IN STATE/NATIONAL PARKS, STATE/NATIONAL FORESTS AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREAS (WMAS)?**

Can you carry a concealed firearm in state/national parks, state/national forests and Wildlife Management Areas in Wisconsin? Yes, with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors.

**STORE IN A VEHICLE IN AN EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT?**

Does Wisconsin have laws relating to storing firearms in private vehicles in an employee parking lot? An employer may not prohibit a licensee, as a condition of employment, from carrying or storing a concealed weapon, a particular type of concealed weapon, or ammunition in the licensee‚Äôs own motor vehicle, regardless of whether the motor vehicle is used in the course of employment or whether the motor vehicle is driven or parked on property used by the employer.

**CARRY IN VEHICLE?**

Can you carry a concealed handgun in a vehicle in Wisconsin? Yes, with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, but not in or on the grounds of a school. The Wisconsin Supreme Court on 4/10/18 ruled that a person must have a license that is valid in Wisconsin to carry a concealed loaded handgun within reach in a vehicle. Without a license, a loaded handgun must not be concealed in any manner, including on a car seat. Based on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals ruling in State v. Walls (1994), in order to be considered openly carried in a vehicle, the handgun must be discernible from the ordinary observation of a person located outside and within the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. Some interpret this to mean above the window line of the vehicle.

Does Wisconsin have laws regarding carrying a concealed firearm while using alcohol or controlled substances?

[Statute References: Wis. Stat. ¬ß¬ß 941.20, 941.237, 939.22(42)]  
As a responsibly armed American, regardless of the laws in your state, it is unwise to carry while under the influence of any substance that could impair your judgment, slow your reaction times, or impact your decision-making abilities. Any decision you make while carrying a firearm could have life-altering consequences.

[Statute Reference: Wis. Stat. ¬ß 175.60(2g)¬©]

### DRIVER‚ÄôS LICENSE LINKED TO Carry License?

Is my Wisconsin driver‚Äôs license linked to my Wisconsin carry license?

Does Wisconsin have preemption laws related to concealed carry (i.e. Does state law supersede local laws regarding the possession of handguns)?

### FAQ: Wisconsin Concealed Carry Questions

### Carry While Gun Hunting?

Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in Wisconsin?

  * Yes, with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, except when shining. Additionally, individuals who own, lease, or legally occupy land and are at least 18 years old may possess a concealed handgun while hunting on those lands without needing a concealed carry license. The handgun must be legal size and caliber for the species being hunted.



### Carry While Bow Hunting?

Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in Wisconsin?

  * Yes. Individuals with a Wisconsin Concealed Weapons License or a license/permit from a state that Wisconsin honors, or qualified former law enforcement officers, may possess the type of firearm they qualified with in a wildlife refuge, Wisconsin state park, or state fish hatchery. However, this does not permit hunting or discharging firearms in these areas, nor does it allow firearms inside state-owned buildings on these properties if posted with signs prohibiting firearms. Individuals who own, lease, or legally occupy land and are at least 18 years old may also possess a concealed handgun while hunting on those lands without needing a concealed carry license.



### Hunter Harassment Law?

Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in Wisconsin?

  * Yes. No person may interfere or attempt to interfere with lawful hunting, fishing, or trapping with the intent to prevent the taking of a wild animal, or intentionally interfere with an activity associated with lawful hunting, fishing, or trapping. [Wis. Stat. ¬ß 29.083]



### What are the Knife Laws in Wisconsin?

Knives are not listed as dangerous weapons in Wisconsin, so knives may be carried openly or concealed. Anyone prohibited from possessing a firearm is also prohibited from carrying a concealed knife. Knives are prohibited at K-12 schools and may be restricted at government facilities by local ordinances. [Wis. Stat. ¬ß¬ß 939.22(10), 941.231, 948.61]

### Wear a COVID Mask & Carry?

I can legally carry a concealed firearm in Wisconsin, but can I wear a COVID-19 protective mask while carrying concealed?

  * One statute in Wisconsin concerns individuals concealing their identity with intent to commit illegal acts or to hide their identity, but it does not specifically address wearing a mask while legally carrying a concealed firearm. There are no statutory or regulatory prohibitions identified that affect carrying a concealed carry license while complying with the order to wear a mask. [Wis. Stat. ¬ß 939.41]
