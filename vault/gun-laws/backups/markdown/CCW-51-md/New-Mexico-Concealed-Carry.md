### Summary of New Mexico Gun Laws

New Mexico operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons licenses issued by the Department of Public Safety. Residents must obtain a New Mexico Concealed Handgun License (CHL), while non-residents can carry with a permit from a state that New Mexico honors.

### Firearm Sales and Background Checks

As of July 1, 2019, background checks are mandatory for private firearm sales in New Mexico under SB-8. Exceptions include sales between law enforcement officers and immediate family members. Selling a gun without a background check is now a misdemeanor offense.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in New Mexico for individuals aged 19 and older who can legally possess a firearm. Some restrictions apply, such as on tribal lands and at establishments selling hard liquor.

### Concealed Carry Requirements

To carry a concealed loaded firearm on foot, residents must hold a New Mexico CHL, which specifies the category and caliber of handgun allowed. The minimum age for obtaining a CHL is 21, and applicants must complete a 15-hour handgun safety course that includes live-fire instruction.

### Reciprocity and Other Provisions

New Mexico recognizes concealed carry permits from states with reciprocity agreements. Non-resident licenses are generally not issued, except for military personnel permanently stationed in New Mexico and their dependents.

### Self-Defense Laws

While New Mexico does not have a specific Castle Doctrine statute, State v. Couch (1946) established that individuals threatened with an attack have the right to stand their ground and defend themselves. Homicide is justifiable under New Mexico law in cases of necessary defense of life, family, or property, lawful defense against imminent danger, or during lawful attempts to apprehend a felon or suppress a riot. Defendants using self-defense must demonstrate reasonable fear of immediate harm, use of appropriate force to counter the threat, and lack of provocation.

These laws outline the framework for firearm ownership, carrying, and self-defense rights in New Mexico.
