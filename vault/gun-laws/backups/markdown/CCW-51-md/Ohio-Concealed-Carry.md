### Summary of Ohio Gun Laws

Ohio is a shall-issue state, with concealed handgun licenses issued at the county level by a county sheriff.

### Purchasing and Carrying Firearms

No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required when buying a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry and concealed carry are legal without a permit. Individuals 21 years old or older, who are not prohibited from carrying or possessing a handgun, are no longer required to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun as of June 12, 2022. Since open carry is not addressed in state statutes, the federal minimum age for possession of a handgun of 18 years old applies. Note: Carrying in vehicles is not specifically addressed in the Constitutional Carry bill. However, according to the Ohio Attorney General, it is legal to possess a loaded firearm in a vehicle.

### Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

Residents can still obtain a CHL. They must complete eight hours of firearms training and meet other criteria to qualify. Current and former servicemen and women can obtain an Ohio CHL without paying the fee or completing a concealed carry class. Additionally, active duty military personnel with a valid military identification card and documentation of successful firearms training that meets or exceeds Ohio‚Äôs requirements do not need to obtain an Ohio license. Non-residents can obtain a CHL if they work in Ohio. In terms of reciprocity, Ohio will honor permits issued by any state or jurisdiction.

### Immunity from Civil Liability

Ohio‚Äôs self-defense laws presume that a person has acted in defense of another or self-defense when applying deadly force if that person is in a place they lawfully have a right to be. Therefore, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not use force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of their residence.

Ohio Rev. Code ¬ß¬ß 2901.09, 2901.05

### Self-Defense Laws

Ohio adheres to the Castle Doctrine and, based on the Governor‚Äôs signing of SB 175 on January 4, 2021, is now a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù state. There is no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of one‚Äôs residence, provided the person is in a place they lawfully have a right to be. You must have a genuine belief that you were in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm and that the use of deadly force was the only way to escape the danger. Deadly force may only be used to protect against serious bodily harm or death.

### Ohio Concealed Carry License Renewal Process

### How do I renew my Ohio Concealed Carry License?

If your license has expired, you cannot carry a concealed weapon until you receive your renewal license from the Sheriff.

**Step 2:** [Download the renewal application](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Forms/Forms-for-Law-Enforcement/Concealed-Carry-License-and-Renewal-Application.aspx).

### FAQ: Ohio Concealed Carry Questions

### Can I wear a COVID mask & carry?

**Question:** I can legally carry a concealed firearm in Ohio, but can I wear a COVID-19 protective mask while carrying concealed?

**Answer:** There is no known statute in Ohio making it illegal to wear a COVID mask while carrying concealed. One state law makes it illegal to commit a misdemeanor while wearing a mask; however, it does not address wearing a mask while legally carrying a concealed firearm. In addition, Geauga County Sheriff Scott Hildenbrand has indicated that it is NOT ILLEGAL for a valid CCW holder to carry your weapon while wearing a mask.

### Can I carry while gun hunting?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry while shotgun/rifle hunting in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes. A person possessing a valid concealed handgun license may carry a concealed handgun while hunting, but it may not be used to shoot, shoot at, or kill any wild animal.

### Can I carry while bow hunting?

**Question:** Can you concealed carry while bow hunting in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes, with a valid Ohio Concealed Handgun License, a concealed handgun license from a state that Ohio honors, or LEOSA.

### Is there a Hunter Harassment Law?

**Question:** Is there a Hunter Harassment Law in Ohio?

**Answer:** Yes. No person shall purposely prevent or attempt to prevent any person from lawfully hunting, trapping, or fishing for a wild animal.

### What are the knife laws in Ohio?

**Question:** What are the knife laws in Ohio?

**Answer:** Based on SB 140, which took effect on April 12, 2021, any knife or cutting instrument is defined as a weapon only if it is used as a weapon. The legislation no longer categorizes a concealed knife, razor, or cutting instrument as a ‚Äúdeadly weapon‚Äù or ‚Äúweapon‚Äù as long as it‚Äôs not used as a weapon. So, Ohio law now allows for the ownership and open carry and concealed carry of any type of knife other than ballistic knives, which are forbidden. Knives are restricted in ‚ÄúSchool Safety Zones‚Äù which include schools, school buildings, school premises, school activities, and school buses; and courthouses or other structures in which a courtroom is located. Ohio municipalities may have additional restrictions. For example, both Akron and Cleveland prohibit the possession in public places of any knife with a blade 2 ¬Ω inches or longer.
