Imagine a world where anybody regardless of age, experience, and expertise could brandish a gun. Yikes Right?

Well, this is why before you can legally own a gun, talk less of concealing it; you need to meet certain requirements set out by a certain group of laws known as “gun laws”.

These laws differ in states and the requirements for a concealed carry Florida will be different in some ways, if not its entirety, from that of another state, say Illinois.

We need not worry about Illinois or any other state as we will be focusing solely on concealed carry Florida and all that it entails in this article.

### Florida Gun laws

Florida has a relatively strict concealed carry law as it only allows permits for concealed carry weapons (CCW) and frowns upon open carry.

A concealed carry weapon is a gun that is hidden from the plain sight of the public.

It could be under your shirt or in your bag but as long as the person sitting next to you has no idea whatsoever, you are good to go.

An open carry on the other hand is a weapon that is brandished for the whole world to see.

There are however exceptions to the practice of open carry under Florida concealed carry law.

The law, in this case, states that residents and non-residents in the state are allowed to practice open carry in Florida if they meet any of the following conditions:

  * If they are traveling to or engaged in camping
  * If they are engaged in fishing
  * If they are going hunting
  * If they are engaged in lawful target shooting
  * If they are involved in the business of manufacturing, repairing, or dealing in firearms



While Florida concealed carry law is a bit lenient on concealed carry, it doesn’t mean that any Ed, Edd n Eddy can purchase a gun and conceal it.

In order to make this possible, individuals living or visiting in Florida need to meet Florida concealed carry requirements.

We will further expatiate these requirements below.

### Florida CCW Reciprocity

As a “shall issue” state, Florida issues its concealed carry licenses to both residents and non-residents alike as long as they are at least 21 years old or under 21 if he or she is a member or veteran of US armed forces.

They also have CCW reciprocity agreements in place with other states.

This means that they agree to recognize concealed carry weapons whose permits are legal and were issued by other states.

As long as the states agree to also recognize concealed carry weapons issued by them.

The Florida CCW reciprocity recognizes 37 states including Arizona and Ohio while 13 states including California and New York do not recognize the Florida CCW permit

### How Does Florida CCW Reciprocity Work?

As stated earlier, Florida is a “shall issue” state that recognizes concealed carry permits from other states as long as they satisfy Florida concealed carry requirements.

It is pertinent to know that these laws vary in different states and something accepted in a state might be deemed unacceptable in another state.

An example of this is the practice of open carry which is prohibited in Florida but accepted in some states such as Arizona. In this case, such a permit will not be recognized by Florida concealed carry law.

Basically, as long as you have a permit in any of the states the Florida CCW reciprocity covers and you meet the requirements for a Florida concealed carry, you need not go for a Florida CCW application when you visit.

In lieu of this, it is important to read up on the states covered by the Florida CCW reciprocity arrangement and the ones that aren’t so you don’t end up in trouble for ignorance.

### Who Can Own a Florida Concealed Carry Permit?
