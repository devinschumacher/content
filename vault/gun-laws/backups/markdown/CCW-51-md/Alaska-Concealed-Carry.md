### Summary of Alaska Gun Laws

Alaska is a shall-issue, permitless carry state. There is no firearms registration, no permit required to purchase firearms, and no background check needed to buy a handgun from a private individual.

Open carry is legal in Alaska for any person who is legally allowed to possess a firearm. The minimum age to open carry is 21. Some areas are off-limits, including K-12 schools and any place where intoxicating liquor is sold for on-site consumption.

Concealed carry is legal for anyone at least 21 years of age or older who can legally possess a firearm ‚Äî a permit is not required. Residents who seek to be exempt from background checks when purchasing additional firearms or who want to carry a firearm in other states can obtain a concealed handgun permit to use in states with which Alaska has a reciprocity agreement. Concealed handgun permits are issued by the Alaska State Police and require a state-approved firearms training course. Alaska does not issue permits to non-residents. Since Alaska has permitless carry, any person 21 years of age and older who can legally possess a firearm may carry a concealed firearm without a license or permit.
