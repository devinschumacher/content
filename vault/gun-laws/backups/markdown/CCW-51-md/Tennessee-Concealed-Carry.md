### Permitless Carry Law

As of July 1, 2021, Tennessee enacted a law allowing permitless open and concealed carry for individuals aged 18 and older, who can lawfully possess a handgun, provided they are in a place they have the right to be and meet additional specified criteria. Some areas remain off-limits, including government buildings and schools.

### Legal Challenge and Changes

In April 2021, the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) filed a lawsuit against Tennessee‚Äôs restrictions on 18- to 20-year-olds carrying concealed firearms in public. On January 23, 2023, the state and FPC reached an agreement in federal court stating these restrictions were unconstitutional and immediately ceased enforcement.

### Tennessee Concealed Handgun Carry Permits

Since January 1, 2020, Tennessee offers two levels of concealed handgun carry permits:

  * **Concealed Handgun Carry Permit (CHCP)** : Requires a 90-minute online course.
  * **Enhanced Handgun Carry Permit (EHCP)** : Requires completion of an 8-hour live training course, allowing permittees to carry openly or concealed in more locations.



Non-residents who work regularly in Tennessee and hold a valid concealed carry permit in their home state may apply for a CHCP after six months of employment.

### Reciprocity

Tennessee recognizes concealed carry permits from all other states.

### Self-Defense Laws

Tennessee adheres to Castle Doctrine principles and has a ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù law:

  * Individuals lawfully present and not engaged in illegal activity have no duty to retreat before using or threatening force likely to cause serious bodily injury or death.
  * Deadly force used within a residence, business, dwelling, or vehicle is presumed justified against an intruder unlawfully and forcibly entering.



### Definitions

  * **Dwelling** : Includes any structure with a roof, designed for human use.
  * **Residence** : A dwelling where a person resides temporarily or permanently.
  * **Vehicle** : Self-propelled motor vehicles for public highway use.
