### Summary of Virginia Gun Laws

### **Permit Application Process**

Virginia operates as a shall-issue state. Residents apply for permits through their county circuit court, while non-residents must submit applications to the State Police.

**Private Handgun Sales**

Virginia does not require permits or registrations for private handgun sales between residents. Recent legislation (SB70/HB2) mandates that all sales, effective July 1, 2020, must be conducted through a licensed dealer who performs a background check. There’s also a restriction of one handgun per month, exempting concealed carry permit holders.

**Open Carry Regulations**

Open carry is permissible in Virginia without a permit for individuals aged 18 and older who are legally eligible to possess firearms. However, localities such as Alexandria and Newport News may prohibit open carry in specific public spaces like buildings, parks, and events.

**Concealed Carry Laws**

Residents holding a Virginia Concealed Handgun Permit (CHP) and non-residents with any valid state license or permit can legally carry concealed firearms. Applicants must be at least 21 years old, complete an approved firearms training course, and demonstrate firearm proficiency. Certain locations, such as airport terminals and places of worship during services, are off-limits. Additionally, municipalities have the authority to restrict firearms in government buildings, public parks, community centers, and outdoor event areas.

**Reciprocity**

Virginia recognizes all out-of-state concealed carry permits, respecting reciprocity agreements.

### Self-Defense Laws in Virginia

**Legal Standards for Self-Defense**

Virginia case law supports self-defense principles akin to the castle doctrine and stand your ground in certain situations. There’s no obligation to retreat if you are lawfully present.

**Defense of Self or Others**

Under Virginia law, individuals not initiating aggression may use reasonable force if they believe they are facing imminent danger of unlawful force, serious bodily harm, or death. Deadly force is justified only when there is an immediate threat of great bodily injury.

**Defense of Dwelling**

Virginia law allows non-deadly force to prevent unlawful entry into a dwelling. Deadly force is justified if a person reasonably believes an intruder intends to cause great bodily harm or death.
