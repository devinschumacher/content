Oregon operates as a shall-issue state for concealed carry permits, managed at the county level by local sheriff‚Äôs offices. The sheriff holds discretion to deny a permit if there are reasonable grounds to believe the applicant poses a danger to themselves or others.

### Firearm Purchase and Transfer Regulations

No license is required for firearm purchases in Oregon. Private-party transfers must occur through a licensed dealer, with both parties present. Federal law mandates background checks and record-keeping by the dealer, and the Oregon State Police retain records of firearm sales for five years.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is legal in Oregon without a permit for individuals aged 18 and older. However, local jurisdictions retain the authority to impose restrictions on open carry, including in public spaces and vehicles. Certain areas like federal facilities and Indian reservations are off-limits for carrying firearms.

### Oregon Concealed Handgun License (CHL)

Concealed carry is permissible with an Oregon CHL, available to applicants aged 21 and above. Applicants must demonstrate handgun competence through an approved course, shooting competition, or military service. Non-residents from contiguous states may also apply for an Oregon CHL. Oregon does not recognize concealed carry permits from other states.

### Use of Physical Force

Oregon law permits the use of physical force in self-defense or defense of others against imminent unlawful physical force. Individuals may use force they reasonably believe necessary to prevent or terminate theft, criminal trespass, or burglary.

### Self-Defense and Deadly Force

Oregon law does not explicitly include a Castle Doctrine or ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù provision. However, individuals are not required to retreat before using force in self-defense in public spaces. Deadly force is justified to prevent certain felonies involving physical force, burglary in a dwelling, or imminent unlawful deadly physical force against oneself or others.

### Use of Deadly Physical Force

The use of deadly physical force is justified in Oregon when preventing a felony involving physical force, burglary in a dwelling, or imminent unlawful deadly physical force. It may also be used to defend against arson or a felony committed with force and violence.
