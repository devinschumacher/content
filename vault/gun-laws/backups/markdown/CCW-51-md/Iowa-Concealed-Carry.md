### Permitless Carry

As of July 1, 2021, Iowa allows permitless carry for both open and concealed carry by individuals aged 21 or older who can legally possess handguns. Iowa continues to issue Permits to Carry Weapons (PCW) for reciprocity purposes.

### Restrictions on Open Carry

Iowa law mandates rules prohibiting open carry of handguns in specific locations, including the capitol building, its surrounding grounds, state parking lots, parking garages, and the state laboratories facility in Ankeny.

### Reciprocity

Iowa recognizes concealed carry permits issued by all states and jurisdictions.

### Self-Defense Laws

#### Defense of Self or Another

Iowa permits the use of reasonable force to defend oneself or another against imminent unlawful force.

#### Use of Deadly Force

Deadly force is justified if an individual reasonably believes it‚Äôs necessary to prevent imminent injury or risk to life or safety, particularly when defending against forcible felonies.

#### Defense of Property

Reasonable force is allowed to prevent criminal interference with personal or public property rights, or to assist in lawful defense of others‚Äô property rights.

#### Civil Immunity

Individuals using reasonable force in defense of self, others, or property are immune from criminal or civil liability for damages incurred by the aggressor.

### Self-Defense Laws Overview

Iowa adheres to Castle Doctrine principles, allowing individuals not engaged in illegal activities to use justified force without the duty to retreat from any lawful place they are present.

### Permit to Acquire Application Process

In order to purchase a handgun in Iowa, whether through a licensed firearms dealer or a private transaction (unless between family members), either a Permit to Acquire a pistol or revolver or a Permit to Carry Weapons is required.

Some counties accept online applications, others accept them by mail, but most require an application to be submitted at the county sheriff‚Äôs office in person. To see if your county of residence accepts online permits, check the county sheriff‚Äôs office website directly.

In order to obtain a Permit to Acquire, you will need a valid driver‚Äôs license or state-issued ID and will have to pay a fee.
