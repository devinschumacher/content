### Summary of Mississippi Gun Laws

Mississippi operates as a shall-issue state for concealed weapons permits, managed by the Department of Public Safety. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

### Buying Handguns

No permit, background check, or firearms registration is required for private handgun purchases. However, buying from a Federal Firearms Dealer necessitates a background check.

### Open Carry Laws

Open carry is lawful in Mississippi for individuals aged 18 and above who can legally possess a firearm. The firearm must be carried visibly in a holster, sheath, or scabbard, except where prohibited, such as schools and bars.

### Concealed Carry Laws

Concealed carry without a permit is permitted for those legally eligible, provided the handgun is carried in a holster or sheath. The state does not specify a minimum age for permitless concealed carry, although the Department of Public Safety generally requires individuals to be 21 years old.

### Types of Permits

Mississippi issues two types of permits at the state level: the Standard Firearms Permit (SFP) and an enhanced version (E-SFP), which grants carry in additional locations. Applicants must be at least 21 years old (or 18 with military affiliation), Mississippi residents, non-residents with valid out-of-state permits, or active duty military stationed in Mississippi.

### Self-Defense Laws

Mississippi adheres to the castle doctrine and ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù principles. Individuals not initiating aggression or engaged in unlawful activity have no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, provided they are in a place where they have a lawful right to be.

### Justifiable Homicide

Homicide is justified under Mississippi law in cases including resisting imminent threat of death or felony, or in the defense of oneself or others facing imminent danger of felony or significant personal injury. The law extends civil immunity to those acquitted of criminal charges related to justifiable self-defense.

For detailed legal advice tailored to your situation, consult with a qualified attorney.
