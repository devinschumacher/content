### Purchasing Firearms

Delaware gun laws do not require permits for purchasing firearms, which include rifles, shotguns, and handguns. However, there are age restrictions: individuals must be at least 18 years old to purchase rifles and shotguns, and at least 21 years old to purchase handguns. Prospective buyers must submit to mandatory criminal and adult record background checks. Antiques or replicas are exempt from these checks, as are law enforcement personnel and those with valid permits to carry concealed weapons. It is illegal to transfer or sell firearms to minors under 18 without parental or guardian consent.

### Firearm Possession

No permit is required for possessing shotguns, rifles, or handguns in Delaware. However, individuals with felony convictions or certain violent misdemeanor offenses are barred from possessing firearms. People with misdemeanor convictions may regain eligibility to possess and purchase firearms five years after their conviction. Those with narcotics or controlled substance convictions are also prohibited from possessing firearms, as are individuals with a history of mental instability or illness. Under Delaware law, air guns and BB guns are included in these restrictions. Minors under 16 may not possess firearms, including air guns and BB guns, unless supervised by an adult. Possession of ammunition or projectiles for air guns or BB guns larger than standard BB shot is a misdemeanor.

### Carrying Firearms

It is illegal to carry a concealed firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, without a proper license. Applications for permits must be processed by the Prothonotary of the Superior Court in the applicant‚Äôs county of residence. Applicants must provide five references from local residents attesting to their moral character, age, and necessity for carrying a concealed weapon. These references must write and sign the letters themselves. The initial license is valid for two years, with renewals every three years. When transporting shotguns and rifles in vehicles, they must be unloaded to comply with Delaware law.
