### Massachusetts Open Carry Laws

Massachusetts has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. The state has extensive gun license requirements related to firearm ownership, possession, and use. Massachusetts also has a ban on assault weapons, the kind often used in mass shootings. In 2021, it had the lowest gun violence death rate in the U.S.

Strong gun control laws do not resolve all public safety concerns related to firearm violence. Those ineligible to buy or possess a gun in Massachusetts may travel to a state with few restrictions to obtain a weapon.

Faced with the constitutional right to bear arms as written in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, states must also balance their gun regulations with the rights of law-abiding gun owners.

### Federal Firearms Laws

With a divided Congress, new firearms laws are rare at the national level. Consensus can be hard to find.

Longstanding federal laws limit the ownership of certain dangerous weapons like machine guns and prohibit certain persons from possessing guns. Law enforcement officers also use the National Instant Background Check System (NICS) to keep firearms out of the wrong hands.

### Massachusetts Gun Control Laws

Massachusetts gun laws are comprehensive and seek to prevent the illegal possession and use of firearms. State licensing regulations provide for universal background checks. Every firearm purchase, sale, or transfer must comply with state requirements for review of the buyer‚Äôs criminal and/or mental health history.

### Gun License Laws

To purchase, possess, and carry a firearm throughout the state, Massachusetts residents must apply for a License to Carry Firearms (LTC). With the LTC permit, you can purchase, possess, and transport all legal handguns, rifles, shotguns, magazines, feeding devices, and ammunition. Residents who seek to purchase, possess, and transport only non-large capacity rifles and shotguns apply for a Firearm Identification Card (FID).

For most jurisdictions, the licensing authority is the local chief of police. To secure the issuance of either type of permit, an applicant needs to complete a state-approved firearms safety course or a qualifying hunter education course. The applicant must also submit their fingerprints and pass the required background check.

Massachusetts does not engage in reciprocity with other states regarding concealed carry permits. Nonresidents who are U.S. citizens and have a concealed carry license from another state may carry a pistol or revolver into Massachusetts in some situations. They must file their request for a temporary license with the Firearms Records Bureau. Such licenses will only be granted for limited purposes that include:

  * Taking part in a pistol or revolver competition
  * Attending a meeting or exhibition of a firearms collectors‚Äô group
  * For hunting, with the license or permit on their person



### Storage Law

State law allows those with a valid gun permit to carry or have a firearm under their control. When a gun owner does not have direct control over the firearm, there are specific regulations about storage.

For example, the owner or authorized user of a gun must store or keep the firearm secured in a locked container. Otherwise, the weapon must be equipped with a mechanical lock or other safety device that makes it inoperable for anyone other than the owner or authorized user.

### Local Gun Regulations

Massachusetts firearms laws also allow cities and counties to enact their own firearm restrictions in certain situations. In some cases, these local laws may be stricter than state law.

Gun owners should inform themselves about state and local laws. Your local police department will provide such information. For example, in Boston, the city provides an online guide for firearm ownership.

### Efforts to Regulate Ghost Guns

Recent efforts by state lawmakers to regulate undetectable or ‚Äúghost‚Äù guns may bear fruit in 2024. Both the State Senate and the State House passed provisions to outlaw guns created through 3D printing that do not have serial numbers and may pass undetected through metal detectors.

A conference committee will seek to work out differences between the bills and present a final version for approval this year.

### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

Firearm possession laws have a wide range of penalties. They can be misdemeanors or felonies. Some common offenses and penalties are:

  * Illegal possession or carrying of a firearm without a license can be treated as a felony, punishable by two and a half years to five years in prison, or as a misdemeanor, punishable by 18 months to two and a half years in jail or a house of correction.
  * Illegal possession or carrying of a machine gun or sawed-off shotgun is a felony, punishable by any term of years in prison, up to life in prison.
  * Illegal transfer, sale, lease, or gift of a large-capacity weapon or a large-capacity feeding device to a minor (under 18) is a felony, punishable by five to 15 years in prison. If the crime involves an adult recipient (18 or older), then the first time is punishable by two and a half to 10 years in prison. A second or later offense is punishable by five to 15 years in prison.



### Penalties for Illegal Possession on or Near School Grounds

It is illegal to carry an unloaded or loaded firearm in any building or on the grounds of any school, college, or university without the written authorization of the board or officer in charge of the school, college, or university. The crime is punishable by up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.

### Red Flag Law?

Yes. A family or household member or a police officer can file a petition for an extreme risk protection order against someone who presents a threat of harm to self or others. A court then determines the matter and can suspend the person‚Äôs access to firearms for up to one year.

### Universal Background Checks?

Yes. Massachusetts requires a criminal background check in virtually all transfers, sales, and purchases of firearms in the state.

### Stand Your Ground Law?

No. Massachusetts law retains a duty to retreat before resorting to deadly force unless the person seeking to use such force is acting in self-defense and in their own home.
