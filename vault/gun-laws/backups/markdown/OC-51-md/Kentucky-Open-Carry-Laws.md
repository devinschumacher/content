The state of Kentucky considers a concealed weapon one that is not easily visible and within immediate access for use by the person. This also extends to firearms in vehicles placed underneath the driver‚Äôs seat. A weapon located in the glove compartment, whether the compartment itself is locked or unlocked, is not considered under the state‚Äôs definition of a concealed weapon.

### Concealed Carry License Requirements

Those who wish to apply for a concealed weapons license must be:

  * At least 21 years old
  * A resident of Kentucky for at least six months
  * A citizen of the United States



U.S. citizens who are currently listed as active duty military and assigned to the state of Kentucky for a period of at least six months are also eligible. Reasons for an applicant to be considered ineligible for a concealed weapons license include:

  * Convictions of crimes punishable by incarceration for a term over one year
  * Convictions of domestic violence misdemeanors
  * Two or more convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or controlled substances within three years of the date of application
  * Owing child support that is greater or equal to the amount to be paid in one-year‚Äôs time
  * Warrants or subpoenas relating to child support or paternity cases
  * Convictions involving assault in the fourth degree or terroristic threatening in the third degree within three years of the application date



Applicants for the concealed weapons license must also complete a firearms safety course that is conducted by the Department of Justice Training. The course is not to be over eight hours long and covers areas such as instruction, care, and cleaning of handguns, marksmanship, and target practice. In order to complete the test, the applicant must successfully hit a target at least eleven times out of twenty shots fired. The application is valid for five years, and the applicant is responsible for any required fees.

### Prohibited Locations for Concealed Firearms

Even with a license, it is prohibited for an individual to carry concealed firearms into public facilities such as schools, police stations, courthouses, daycare centers, and any businesses that sell alcohol for consumption on the premises.
