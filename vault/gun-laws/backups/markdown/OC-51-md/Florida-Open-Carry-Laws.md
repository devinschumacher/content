This provision also applies to air guns and BB guns; the only weapon that may be sold to a minor is an ordinary pocket knife. Minors may possess a weapon only while engaged in legal sporting, hunting, and recreational activities under supervision, or at their place of residence with the firearm unloaded.

A licensed firearms dealer must obtain a completed form from the prospective buyer and receive approval for the transfer of a firearm from the Department of Law Enforcement, pending a background check. It is illegal for a dealer to deliver a weapon without completing this process. Exempt from background checks are other licensed dealers, law enforcement and military personnel, and individuals with a concealed weapons permit. There is a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases from licensed dealers, which is waived for those with concealed weapons permits or who are trading in another handgun.

### Firearm Possession

No permit is required for possessing shotguns, rifles, or handguns in Florida. However, individuals with felony convictions or certain violent misdemeanor offenses are barred from possessing firearms. Individuals with misdemeanor convictions may regain eligibility to possess and purchase firearms five years after their conviction. People with narcotics or controlled substance convictions are also prohibited from possessing firearms, as are individuals with a history of mental instability or illness. Under Florida law, air guns and BB guns are included in these restrictions. Minors under 16 may not possess firearms, including air guns and BB guns, unless supervised by an adult. Possession of ammunition or projectiles for air guns or BB guns larger than standard BB shot is a misdemeanor.

### Carrying Firearms

It is illegal to carry a concealed firearm, whether loaded or unloaded, without a proper license. Applications for permits must be processed by the Department of Agriculture. Applicants must provide five references from local residents attesting to their moral character, age, and necessity for carrying a concealed weapon. These references must write and sign the letters themselves. The initial license is valid for two years, with renewals every three years. When transporting shotguns and rifles in vehicles, they must be unloaded to comply with Florida law.

### No ‚ÄúDuty to Retreat‚Äù Clause

A unique aspect of Florida‚Äôs gun laws is the ‚Äúno duty to retreat‚Äù clause, which states that an individual has the right to defend themselves by any means necessary, including deadly force, if attacked in a location where they are lawfully present. This provision allows individuals to protect themselves without retreating, provided they are not trespassing and feel it is necessary to prevent harm or death to themselves or others.

### Exceptions for Carrying Firearms

  * Individuals involved in sport and target shooting, and while traveling to and from such locations.
  * Individuals involved in hunting or trapping, and while traveling to and from such activities.
  * Law enforcement and military personnel.
  * Individuals involved in the firearms business, such as dealing and repairing.



A firearm may be transported in a private vehicle as long as it is in a secured case and not easily accessible by anyone in the vehicle. This specifically pertains to handguns, while rifles and shotguns may be transported anywhere in a private vehicle, provided the use of such firearms is legal, and they are not concealed on the person.
