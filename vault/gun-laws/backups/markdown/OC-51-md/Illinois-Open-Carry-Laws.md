As the state continues to shape its laws, it remains essential for stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens to engage in informed discussions that prioritize both individual freedoms and community security.

### Firearms Owner’s Identification Card (FOID)

Illinois statutes regarding firearms have proven to be among the more restrictive in the United States. The possession, purchase, and carrying of firearms are contingent upon an individual obtaining a Firearms Owner’s Identification Card (FOID). The FOID application process is unique to Illinois and is one of the key features of the state’s firearm laws.

### Firearm Registration

The registration of firearms is not required by Illinois statutes, with the exception of the city of Chicago, where any type of firearm must be registered.

### Firearm Purchase Requirements

To purchase any kind of firearm, be it rifles, shotguns, or handguns, an individual must have a FOID. Rifles and shotguns are subject to a holding period of twenty-four hours, while handguns have a waiting period of seventy-two hours for actual delivery. This waiting period does not apply to law enforcement officers, authorized dealers, or non-residents at a gun show approved by the Illinois Department of State Police.

### Record Keeping

Dealers are required to retain records of a sale for ten years, including the firearm’s description and serial number, and the buyer’s identification information and FOID number. All purchases are contingent upon a background check, including firearm transfers conducted at gun shows. The minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm in Illinois is eighteen.

### FOID Eligibility Requirements

The FOID application is submitted to the Illinois State Police and can be obtained online or by contacting the Firearm Owners Identification Program. Certain requirements must be met to be eligible for a FOID:

  * Be over the age of 21 (those under 21 must provide a written letter of consent signed by a parent or guardian, who must also be eligible for a FOID).
  * No records of felony convictions.
  * Not addicted to narcotics.
  * No admissions to a mental facility in the past five years.
  * Mentally and physically capable of handling a firearm.
  * Not an illegal alien.
  * No current restraining orders.
  * No convictions of battery, assault, or similar crimes involving a firearm in the past five years.
  * No convictions of domestic battery or similar crimes committed after January 1, 1998.



The FOID application must be accompanied by proper identification materials, such as a driver’s license or state ID card. The FOID has a fee of ten dollars and is valid for five years from the date it was issued.

### Possession of Firearms

The possession of a firearm requires an individual to have obtained a FOID. This also extends to ammunition. For those under the age of 18, it is illegal under Illinois firearm law to possess a firearm.

### Restrictions on Firearm Possession

Under Illinois statutes, it is unlawful to possess a firearm in any public forum or establishment, as well as schools. Students who are exempt may possess firearms if they provide proof that they are engaged in firearm training classes, target shooting on school grounds, or other approved activities. Firearms must be transported unloaded and in an appropriate case.

### Firearm Possession in Chicago

In the city of Chicago, possession of firearms is illegal unless they are appropriately registered with the authorities. A certificate must be carried at all times the firearm is in possession or being carried and must be readily presentable to law enforcement officials if requested. Handguns that have not been registered before 1982 are not allowed, and any handgun in Chicago after that date is illegal under Illinois law.

### Carrying Firearms

The carrying of firearms is restricted to rifles and shotguns, and individuals must have a valid FOID. No permit is issued for carrying handguns, making the practice illegal under Illinois statutes. Firearms can only be carried on one’s personal property or place of business. Exceptions apply for activities such as hunting and other recreational purposes, provided the individual has valid licenses for such activities. Firearms must be transported disassembled or rendered non-functional and not easily accessible in the vehicle. Firearms can also be transported unloaded and in a suitable case, as long as the individual has a valid FOID on their person.
