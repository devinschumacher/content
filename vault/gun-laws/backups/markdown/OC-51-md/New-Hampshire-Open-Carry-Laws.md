### Recent Supreme Court Rulings

Recent landmark decisions like District of Columbia v. Heller and New York Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen have shaped gun rights jurisprudence. These cases affirmed an individual’s right to possess and carry firearms, influencing state-level policies on concealed and open carry.

### Permitless Carry Laws

New Hampshire implemented permitless carry legislation in 2017, aligning with the “constitutional carry” concept, allowing law-abiding citizens to carry loaded firearms openly or concealed without a permit.

### New Hampshire Gun Control Laws at a Glance

New Hampshire’s firearm laws are relatively permissive compared to other states. The state does not impose waiting periods or background checks on private sales, and there are no restrictions on assault weapons or ghost guns.

While New Hampshire does not mandate firearm licenses for ownership, a concealed carry license is available for reciprocity with other states, though not required for concealed carry.

### Machine Gun Laws

New Hampshire law does not restrict the possession of machine guns, deferring instead to federal regulations.

### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

Penalties for firearm violations range from misdemeanors to felonies, depending on the offense, including possession by prohibited persons and alterations to firearm identification marks.
