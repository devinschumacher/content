### Current Alaska Gun Laws

### General Overview

Currently, Alaska gun laws do not require registration or a permit to purchase or carry rifles, shotguns, and/or handguns. Although Alaska gun laws are subject to federal gun laws, they also maintain their own unique provisions and guidelines.

### Purchasing Firearms

To purchase a firearm in Alaska, the main requirement is that the individual be at least 18 years of age. However, it is illegal to sell or transfer any firearm to people who have been found guilty of committing a felony. This statute also includes any individual who was tried as a minor but, if tried as an adult, would have resulted in a felony conviction.

An individual found guilty of a felony may eventually become eligible to purchase a firearm, but only after ten years or more have passed since the date of sentencing. It is also illegal to sell a firearm to any person who may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs or has a mental condition that would prohibit the use of a firearm.

### Possession of Firearms

Possession of firearms in the state closely resembles the regulations for purchasing shotguns, rifles, and handguns. There is no registration or permit required to possess a firearm. However, individuals who have been found guilty on felony charges are prohibited from possessing firearms unless such charges occurred over ten years ago and have been dismissed.

### Unique Regulations

Some regulations are unique to the state of Alaska. Under the law, it is illegal to possess a firearm on school grounds, either public or private, unless given strict permission by the proper officials of the school or district. The only exception is that an individual at least 21 years of age may possess a firearm in a vehicle.

Possession of firearms is also prohibited on other public and private grounds, such as government buildings, courthouses or courtrooms, daycare centers, and domestic violence and sexual abuse shelters.

It is also prohibited for any place that sells liquor to possess a loaded firearm on the premises. The only exceptions are the owner or lessee and their immediate employees while on the business site.

### Concealed Carry

Alaska gun laws allow for carrying a concealed handgun, as long as the person is over the age of 21 and meets the requirements to be considered eligible to possess a firearm. A permit is not necessary; however, permits are available for those who want to be considered eligible to carry a concealed firearm in other states. The permit is available to those who have been residents of the state for over 90 days prior to the application, have not been convicted of two or more misdemeanors in the past six years, and have not been ordered to enter an alcohol treatment or drug abuse program currently or within the past three years.
