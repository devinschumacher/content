Minors under the age of 18 can purchase firearms only if they provide written consent signed by a parent or legal guardian. It is illegal, under Idaho gun law, to provide minors under the age of 16 with ammunition ‚Äî shells or gunpowder ‚Äî except for rounds or shells to be used in shotguns or rifles up to a .22 caliber. This transaction of ammunition also requires the written consent of a parent or guardian.

### Possession of Firearms

There is no permit or license required for the possession of firearms, but Idaho gun laws do require a license to carry concealed weapons. Though permits are not needed, Idaho law does have possession restrictions. Any person with a prior felony conviction is not allowed to possess any firearms. Minors under the age of 18 may possess a rifle or shotgun only with the written permission of a parent or guardian. It is unlawful for a minor to possess a handgun.

### Carrying Firearms

A concealed weapon is defined by Idaho gun law as a weapon being carried on a person physically, whether on their person or in a container, where it can be easily accessed by the person for use. It is also considered a concealed weapon if the firearm is not easily visible when being carried. Applicants for a concealed weapons license must be over the age of 21 and a legal resident of the United States. Applicants may be considered ineligible if they fit any of the following criteria:

  * Conviction of a crime with a jail sentence of over one year.
  * Abuse of illegal drugs, controlled substances, and/or alcohol.
  * A dishonorable discharge from the military.
  * Under an order of restraint.
  * Conviction of a misdemeanor crime of a violent nature within the past three years from the date of the application.



The application for the license is submitted to the director of the Idaho State Police, with fingerprinting required for first-time applicants. The director of the state police also has the discretion of issuing a license for concealed weapons to individuals between the ages of 18 to 21, if such applicants provide an undeniable necessity to carry a concealed weapon.

It is important to note that a concealed weapons license is not necessary if a person in possession of a concealed weapon is outside the border limits of cities and/or towns.
