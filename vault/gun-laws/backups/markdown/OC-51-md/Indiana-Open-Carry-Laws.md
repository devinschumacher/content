### Restrictions on Firearm Possession

It is illegal to possess a firearm on school property or property used by the school, with exceptions for transportation by qualified individuals.

### Handgun Carrying License

Carrying a handgun requires an Indiana license. The application must be made to the chief law enforcement officer of the applicant‚Äôs county or municipality of residence or employment. The application must include:

  * Name and address
  * Occupation
  * Age, race, and nationality
  * Criminal record, if any
  * Height and weight
  * Reason for applying for the license



Law enforcement officials will investigate the applicant‚Äôs background. This information, along with fingerprints, is forwarded to the Indiana State Police Superintendent for further investigation if necessary. If no legitimate reason is found to deny the license, it will be granted.

### License Validity and Fees

The license is valid for four years from the date of issue. An option for an unlimited license is available, valid for the applicant‚Äôs lifetime. Fees for applications vary, with local and state impositions, such as a four-year unlimited license costing ten dollars locally and thirty dollars for the state.

### Specific Provisions and Penalties

Indiana law has specific provisions regarding firearms:

  * Students found in possession of firearms on school property will be expelled.
  * Transporting a firearm in an off-road vehicle or snowmobile requires the weapon to be unloaded, securely stored in a case, with a trigger lock implemented.
