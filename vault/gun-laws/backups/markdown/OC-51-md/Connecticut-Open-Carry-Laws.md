### Firearm Registration and Records

Connecticut requires the registration of certain types of firearms. While the majority of firearms are exempt, all weapons classified as assault weapons must be registered with the state. However, no permit is required for purchasing firearms, except for handguns.

### Eligibility for Firearm Purchase

To be eligible to purchase a firearm in Connecticut, a person must be at least 21 years old, deemed capable of handling a firearm safely as per federal statutes, and possess a handgun eligibility certificate if seeking to purchase handguns. This certificate must be issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety, and there is a two-week waiting period from the date the application is submitted.

Once the application is approved, the certificate is issued by the Commissioner of Public Safety pending receipt of a background check from the FBI. The handgun eligibility certificate is then issued to the prospective firearms purchaser within 60 days of the commissioner receiving the FBI background check. The certificate is valid for up to five years from the day it is issued.

### Firearm Safety Course

All firearm buyers must complete a safety course, be fingerprinted, and pay all fees associated with obtaining a firearm. The waiting period is waived for law enforcement, armed forces members, and those holding a valid Connecticut hunting license.

### Firearm Possession

No permit is required for the possession of firearms in Connecticut. However, it is illegal for convicted felons to possess firearms. Those with juvenile delinquency records may also be barred from possessing a weapon, depending on the crime. Crimes that bar past juvenile delinquents from possessing firearms include illegal possession of a controlled substance, second-degree stalking, rioting, unlawful restraint, third-degree assault, negligent homicide, and court-ordered confinement for mental illness or mental instability in the prior year.

Connecticut also prohibits illegal aliens or those unable to provide proper identification as U.S. citizens or permanent residents from possessing firearms.

### Carrying Handguns

A permit is required to carry handguns outside of one‚Äôs residence, whether the weapon is concealed or not. This includes transporting a handgun. An individual can apply for the permit at the local police department or town hall. To be eligible, an applicant must be at least 21 years old, a legal resident of the United States, and have a home or work address in the local town of application.

### Assault Weapons

Assault weapons are illegal to possess under Connecticut law unless the firearm was acquired before 1993 and registered before 1994 with the Connecticut State Police. Registered assault weapons are only allowed in the following locations:

  * The owner‚Äôs residence, place of business, or private property.
  * Sanctioned and commissioned Connecticut gun clubs.
  * Locations where the exhibition of an assault weapon is for educational purposes.
  * While transporting an assault weapon between the aforementioned locations.



Understanding and adhering to these regulations is crucial for ensuring responsible gun ownership and public safety in Connecticut.
