### Purchasing Firearms

Georgia gun law does not require a permit to purchase, registration of firearms, or the licensing of owners. A permit to carry is only instituted for firearms that can be legally categorized as handguns. Under Georgia gun law, it is unlawful for a person under the age of 18 to possess a handgun. Consequently, it is illegal for any person to give, sell, or transfer a handgun to anyone under the age of 18. However, there are exceptions in which a minor may possess a handgun. A minor may possess a handgun with the permission of a parent, legal guardian, or under the supervision of a qualified or certified instructor, or professional.

Based on the contingency of permission by an adult, a minor may possess a handgun if attending a firearm education or safety course. This also includes activities such as hunting, lawful sporting events, shooting competitions, or fishing. While traveling to and from such events, locations, or activities, a minor may possess a handgun in a private vehicle as long as the weapon is not loaded. In situations such as hunting, trapping, or fishing, the handgun must be in plain sight and fully exposed if it is loaded. Possession is also allowed for minors if they are on property under the supervision of a parent or guardian, and have full permission to possess the handgun. Minors convicted of violence-related crimes are entirely barred from being able to bear a handgun or other firearms. Georgia gun law states that any individual convicted of a felony crime is prohibited from possessing or transporting any shotgun, rifle, or handgun.

### Carrying Firearms

To carry a handgun or another type of concealable firearm, Georgia gun law requires an individual to obtain a license or permit. The license allows a person to carry a handgun openly, either in a holster or similar device, which can then be concealed by clothing, a purse, suitcase, or another type of container. This also includes concealment in a motor vehicle. Those wishing to obtain a license to carry a handgun must be over the age of 21 and not meet the following criteria:

  * Convicted of a felony that has not been officially pardoned by the necessary agencies or officials.
  * Convicted of a misdemeanor crime of a violent nature in the prior five years.
  * Convicted of unlawful weapons carrying charges in the past three years.
  * Convicted of charges relating to drug or substance abuse.
  * Been institutionalized in a facility for mental instability or drug and/or alcohol abuse.



The application must be submitted to the proper law enforcement agency, which will then conduct a federal and state criminal background check. If there are no negative statements or history on an applicant‚Äôs record, a judge issues the license to carry within 60 days of receipt of the application.

A judge also has the discretion to grant a license to carry to those who have been committed to a mental hospital or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse. The judge will seek the recommendations of the officials or personnel of such institutions, and then may decide to grant or deny the application to carry concealed weapons. The license remains valid for a period of five years and is taken under oath to a judge.

It is not necessary to obtain the carry license if the possession of a firearm is within the limits of a person‚Äôs home or place of business. This also extends to the transportation of a firearm, as long as it is in plain view or stored in a glove compartment; if unloaded, the firearm must be separate from any ammunition and secured in a case.

### No ‚ÄúDuty to Retreat‚Äù Clause

A unique aspect of Georgia‚Äôs gun laws is the ‚Äúno duty to retreat‚Äù clause, which states that an individual has the right to defend themselves by any means necessary, including deadly force, if attacked in a location where they are lawfully present. This provision allows individuals to protect themselves without retreating, provided they are not trespassing and feel it is necessary to prevent harm or death to themselves or others.

### Exceptions for Carrying Firearms

  * Individuals involved in sport and target shooting, and while traveling to and from such locations.
  * Individuals involved in hunting or trapping, and while traveling to and from such activities.
  * Law enforcement and military personnel.
  * Individuals involved in the firearms business, such as dealing and repairing.



A firearm may be transported in a private vehicle as long as it is in a secured case and not easily accessible by anyone in the vehicle. This specifically pertains to handguns, while rifles and shotguns may be transported anywhere in a private vehicle, provided the use of such firearms is legal, and they are not concealed on the person.
