### Current Arizona Gun Laws

### General Overview

In accordance with Arizona gun laws, the registration of firearms is not necessary. Additionally, there is no requirement for permits or applications to purchase, possess, or carry firearms, with the sole exception of carrying a concealed handgun, which requires a permit.

### Purchasing Firearms

The general guidelines for purchasing a firearm are straightforward:

  * It is illegal to sell or transfer any kind of firearm to a minor unless written consent by the parent or legal guardian can be produced; this also includes any kind of ammunition.
  * It is illegal to sell a firearm to a “prohibited possessor.” Arizona law defines a “prohibited possessor” as:
  * Any individual convicted of a felony involving violence and the use of deadly force, including minors who have committed such an offense within ten years from the date of the crime.
  * An individual currently under probation due to a conviction for a felony or domestic abuse charge, or currently under parole.
  * A person currently serving a prison sentence.
  * A minor unaccompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or qualified hunting or firearms instructor, with the exception of transporting an unloaded firearm for hunting and practicing between 5:00 am and 10:00 pm to an area where shooting firearms is allowed.



### Possession of Firearms

Arizona gun laws restrict the possession of firearms for “prohibited possessors.” Other regulations include:

  * No person may knowingly possess a firearm that does not have the manufacturer’s serial number or has been altered or destroyed, unless a member of the appropriate law enforcement or military. The exception to this rule would be museums or a qualified and certified person allowed to handle such firearms for educational purposes at specified institutions.



### Carrying Firearms

According to Arizona gun laws, carrying firearms is generally allowed as long as the weapon is not concealed. There are specific rules and regulations to ensure public safety:

  * No person is allowed to carry a concealed firearm in Arizona unless the appropriate permit can be produced. A “concealed weapon,” as defined by Arizona gun laws, refers to a handgun that is not in plain sight or easily visible. A handgun in a belt holster that is visible or carried in luggage is not considered concealed.
  * To qualify for a permit to carry a concealed weapon, an individual must be over 21 years of age, a resident of the state, submit fingerprints for a background check, complete a firearm safety program, and provide the necessary fees and costs. The permit is valid for four years and must be renewed every four years.



### Exceptions to Concealed Carry

Although a permit is required to carry a concealed handgun, there are exceptions under Arizona gun law:

  * No person can carry a firearm to public events unless otherwise specified by law, excluding events involving hunting or similar activities.
  * This restriction also applies to other public facilities, such as schools, with the exception of unloaded firearms in a vehicle under the use of an adult. If the vehicle is not being operated, the firearm must not be visible, and the car must be locked.
  * Firearms may be approved by a school-sanctioned program to be on the property.
