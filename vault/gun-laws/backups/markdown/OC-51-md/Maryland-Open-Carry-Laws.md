### Maryland Open Carry Laws

Gun control laws in the U.S. remain highly controversial due to increases in gun violence and mass shootings, prompting public demand for laws to protect the public. At the same time, lawmakers must balance safety concerns with individualsâ€™ right to own guns. Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have upheld an individualâ€™s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, influencing the drafting of firearm-related laws.

Each stateâ€™s gun laws vary, reflecting specific local concerns and political climates. Maryland has more restrictive gun laws than many other states, including an assault weapons ban passed in 2013 following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut.

### Maryland Gun Control Laws

Marylandâ€™s gun control laws are comprehensive, addressing the purchase, possession, use, and carry of firearms. The state also restricts who can possess guns and bans certain dangerous firearms and accessories.

To keep guns out of the wrong hands, Maryland prohibits individuals under 21 from possessing handguns or assault weapons and those under 18 from purchasing long guns (rifles, shotguns) or ammunition. Additionally, convicted felons and individuals with specific other criminal convictions, as well as those adjudicated as incompetent or not legally responsible due to mental health issues, are banned from possessing firearms and ammunition.

In 2018, Maryland passed a red flag law allowing police officers or family members to petition a court to remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others.

### Maryland Permit Laws

Maryland requires anyone purchasing a handgun or assault weapon to be at least 21 years old and complete an application for a purchase license. Those seeking to buy, rent, or receive a handgun must also complete an approved firearms safety training course and obtain a handgun qualification license (HQL).

The Maryland State Police oversees the permit application process through its licensing division. A criminal background check is required for all firearm transactions, whether through licensed dealers or private transactions. Gun dealers must also be licensed to operate a firearms business in the state.

Individuals seeking to wear and carry a handgun, concealed or open, must apply for a concealed carry permit. Without this permit, they are limited to carrying the firearm only at their residence, on land they own, or at their place of business. Concealed carry permits are available to individuals who are 21 years old and otherwise eligible under state laws.

### Location Prohibitions

Maryland law prohibits carrying firearms in certain locations, with common exemptions for on-duty law enforcement officers and active members of the Armed Forces. These prohibited locations include:

  * Areas for children and vulnerable adults (e.g., preschools, schools)
  * Public infrastructure and government buildings (e.g., state and local government buildings, university buildings, polling locations)
  * Special purpose areas (e.g., stadiums, museums, amusement parks, racetracks, video lottery facilities, establishments that serve alcohol or cannabis for consumption)
  * Private property open to the public unless explicitly permitted by signage
  * Demonstrations in a public place or in a vehicle within 1,000 feet when law enforcement has provided notice



### Preemption Law

Maryland state law generally preempts localities from passing gun regulations that conflict with state laws. However, exceptions exist for local government regulations involving minors and the discharge of guns, except at shooting ranges. Cities like Baltimore and Annapolis can regulate gun-related conduct in or within 100 feet of parks, churches, schools, public buildings, and other places of public assembly.
