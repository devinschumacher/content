### Current California Gun Laws

### General Overview

California gun laws are among the most complex in the country. Like many other states, California does not require permits to purchase firearms or the registration of rifles and shotguns. However, the state does require the registration of handguns and firearms considered ‚Äúassault weapons.‚Äù Law enforcement agencies in California record every single purchase of firearms that fall into these two categories. New residents have 60 days to register their firearms upon moving to the state.

### Purchasing Firearms

California has stringent guidelines for purchasing firearms:

  * All firearm sales, including private sales, must be processed through a licensed and certified firearms dealer.
  * Purchasers must provide appropriate identification, including a driver‚Äôs license or state-issued ID card, and proof of residence.
  * Non-residents cannot purchase firearms in California.
  * A Handgun Safety Certificate, obtained by passing a written test, is required for purchasing handguns.
  * The entire application process includes providing a thumbprint and undergoing a background check by the California Department of Justice.
  * There is a ten-day waiting period for all firearm purchases. If the purchase is approved, the buyer has 30 days to pick up the weapon from the dealer. If not picked up within 30 days, the process must be repeated.
  * A person is limited to purchasing one firearm per 30-day period.



### Possession of Firearms

Regulations on possession include:

  * Convicted felons, individuals with a history of mental illness, drug addiction, or mental instability, and those with misdemeanor charges of a violent nature are ineligible to possess firearms.
  * Minors under 16 may possess a handgun only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian and with written consent.
  * The carrying of loaded firearms in public is generally prohibited, with exceptions for shooting ranges, hunting, private property, or business premises, and situations involving reasonable concern for life or lawful arrests.
  * Concealed weapons are allowed with a permit. Visible handguns in holsters are also permitted.
  * Firearms in vehicles must be in the trunk or a locked case to be considered ‚Äúunconcealed.‚Äù Guns under seats or in glove compartments are considered ‚Äúconcealed.‚Äù



### Assault Weapons Regulations

Assault weapons have specific regulations:

  * It is illegal to sell or transfer assault weapons or .50 caliber BMG rifles.
  * Assault weapons must be registered with the state. Unregistered assault weapons must be relinquished to authorities.
  * Registered assault weapons may only be possessed at the owner‚Äôs private residence, private property, or business premises.
  * Possession of more than ten rounds of ammunition for any assault weapon is illegal.



California‚Äôs complex gun laws reflect its efforts to control firearm activity, particularly in urban areas, and address public safety concerns while respecting individual rights.
