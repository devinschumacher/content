### Current Arkansas Gun Laws

### General Overview

Arkansas gun laws do not necessitate the registering of any shotgun, rifle, or handgun. However, machine guns are required to be registered under federal law, as well as with the Secretary of State. Arkansas gun law defines a machine gun as a weapon that can discharge five shots automatically or semi-automatically by a single action on the triggering mechanism.

### Purchasing Firearms

Arkansas gun law does not require a state permit for the purchase or possession of a firearm. An individual may be eligible to purchase firearms as long as they are at least 18 years old. Minors must have expressed consent from a parent or legal guardian responsible for their well-being to purchase a firearm.

### Possession of Firearms

Arkansas law includes more regulations regarding possession:

  * It is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony crime, deemed mentally unfit by law, or involuntarily committed to a mental institution to possess a firearm.
  * It is unlawful to possess a handgun in a manner that it can be easily used as a weapon to inflict harm against another person unless:
  * The person is on their own private property or place of business where they have a vested interest.
  * The person is affiliated with law enforcement or the military, including individuals requested to assist in a particular situation by law enforcement or military officials during duty. This also includes security officers and prison guards.
  * The person is transporting the firearm to and from hunting activities, sporting activities, and educational firearm-related courses and classes.
  * A minor possesses an unloaded firearm and is under the supervision of a parent, legal guardian, or qualified firearm instructor.



### Carrying Firearms

Arkansas gun laws allow for the carrying of a concealed handgun only with a license or permit. The application for the license is made directly to the state police. The license is valid for a total of four years and may include up to three handguns. The license to carry a concealed handgun must be presented with another form of valid identification to be considered within the constraints of the law.

### Eligibility for Concealed Carry License

Qualified individuals for the license must be:

  * At least 21 years old
  * A resident of the state of Arkansas for over a year
  * Not convicted of a felony or violent act
  * Not having attempted or threatened to commit suicide
  * Not voluntarily or involuntarily committed to a program due to alcohol, domestic violence, or drug substance abuse



Regarding controlled substances, an applicant must not have been found guilty of a crime or submitted into a program in the past three years. For alcohol, the applicant must not have committed more than two related crimes in the past three years.

### Restrictions on Concealed Carry

Even though licensed carriers of handguns are legal by law, they are restricted in several places. They cannot enter:

  * Public places such as police and law enforcement facilities and buildings
  * Schools or colleges
  * Any place of business that sells alcohol for consumption on its premises, except for restaurants
