### Gun Control Laws in Virginia

The Commonwealth of Virginia has a long history with gun regulations. Its first General Assembly, in 1619, passed a gun control law making it a crime to provide arms to indigenous people. State regulation of firearms has changed over time. As in other states, Virginia gun control laws limit the ownership and carrying of certain weapons. Virginia laws also restrict who is permitted to own guns. For example, people convicted of a felony or who are subject to a protective order (restraining order) may not own or buy guns.

In recent years, the state enacted new measures aimed at preventing gun violence. This included a move toward universal background checks on firearm purchases and the passage of an extreme risk protective order law. Other laws sought to strengthen restrictions imposed on those convicted of domestic violence and encourage the safe storage of firearms.
