  * Individuals seeking to purchase a handgun must apply and provide their name, address, driver‚Äôs license number, race, gender, and details about the firearm. A statement of eligibility is also required. There is a five-day waiting period for the delivery of the pistol to the buyer.

### Record Keeping

  * While no formal registration is required, police records are kept for all firearm purchases, which acts as a form of registration.

Minors engaged in hunting or sporting activities may carry firearms during these activities, including travel to and from such activities, provided the firearm is unloaded and not easily accessible in a motor vehicle.



### Eligibility Requirements

  * Individuals with felony charges are disqualified from possessing firearms. Non-citizens need an alien firearm license unless they are Canadian residents with a valid hunting or sporting license from their province.
