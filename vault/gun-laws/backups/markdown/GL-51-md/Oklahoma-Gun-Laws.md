### Federal and State Gun Control Laws: An Overview

Federal and state gun control laws regulate the manufacture, purchase, sale, use, and possession of firearms and ammunition. These laws aim to balance public safety and the rights of gun owners to engage in lawful activities such as self-defense.

Federal laws cover the manufacture of firearms and the licensing of gun dealers, restricting the ownership and possession of certain dangerous weapons and identifying individuals prohibited from having guns, such as convicted felons and those convicted of domestic violence.

The federal government enforces U.S. law through agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). Congress created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to assist federal, state, and local law enforcement in keeping guns out of the hands of those who cannot have them.

Each state has its own restrictions on the purchase and use of firearms under its gun control laws. These laws must be reasonable and consider the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms for legal purposes.

### Oklahoma Gun Laws

Oklahoma is known for its gun-friendly reputation, striving to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to own and use guns. The state has refrained from enacting new gun regulations to address increases in firearm violence, opting instead to expand gun rights in recent years.

In Oklahoma, no license or permit is required to purchase a gun, and there is no waiting period after buying a firearm. If you purchase a gun from a licensed dealer, federal law mandates a criminal background check before delivery. However, private transactions do not require a background check.

While Oklahoma has not banned assault weapons, it prohibits the possession and use of certain dangerous weapons and ammunition, such as sawed-off shotguns or rifles (unless registered under federal law) and restricted bullets that penetrate body armor. Unauthorized use of body armor during a crime can also result in additional prison time.

State law prohibits firearm possession by convicted felons and noncitizens illegally in the U.S. It is also a crime to provide firearms to felons, individuals under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and those deemed mentally incompetent.

Minors (under 18 years of age) are generally prohibited from possessing firearms, except under certain conditions such as:

  * Participation in hunting
  * Hunter safety classes
  * Education and training in firearm safety
  * Target shooting
  * Skeet, trap, or other sporting events and competitions



### Oklahoma Carry Laws

Oklahoma has recently loosened restrictions on both concealed and open carry of firearms. In 2019, the state enacted a permitless carry law allowing individuals 21 years or older (18â€“20 if in the Armed Forces, Reserves, or National Guard) to carry firearms, concealed or open, without a background check or handgun license. However, individuals must still comply with state and federal laws and risk arrest and prosecution if they fall under prohibited categories.

Individuals can still apply for a concealed handgun license for reciprocity in other states through the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) or local sheriffâ€™s office. Applicants must show residency in Oklahoma, prove it with a valid state ID, and complete firearms safety training approved by the Oklahoma Council of Law Enforcement Education and Training (CLEET).

Oklahoma gun carry laws often provide exceptions for carrying firearms by peace officers and other law enforcement officers on duty, as well as for self-defense, hunting, fishing, educational and recreational activities, judges, and living history reenactments.

### Prohibited Locations

Even states with reduced obstacles to carrying weapons, like Oklahoma, prohibit firearms in certain locations, including:

  * Government buildings used for conducting business with the public
  * Courthouses and courtrooms
  * Prisons, jails, and other detention facilities
  * Public and private elementary and secondary schools
  * Colleges and universities
  * Publicly owned or operated sports arenas and venues, unless allowed by the event holder
  * Gambling locations, unless allowed by the property owner
  * Establishments where the sale of alcoholic beverages is the primary purpose of the business
  * Places set aside by local or state government for an event with minimum security provisions



Exceptions are made for law enforcement and other special situations.

### Stand Your Ground Law?

Yes. Along with the more traditional Castle Doctrine, permitting the use of deadly force to defend oneâ€™s home, place of business, or motor vehicle from an intruder, Oklahoma adopted a Stand Your Ground law. This law provides that a person who is not engaged in unlawful activity and who is attacked in a place they have a legal right to be may stand their ground and meet force with force. This includes the use of deadly force if a person reasonably believes they need to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm or the commission of a forcible felony. There is no duty to retreat before engaging in appropriate defensive force.
