### Gun Control Laws in Wyoming

Every state has its own gun control laws that regulate the purchase and use of firearms. As a state known as the Cowboy State, Wyoming has relatively lenient gun control laws. Wyoming law does not require a license, permit, or registration to buy or own a firearm. The state sets the minimum age to buy a long gun (rifle or shotgun) at 18 and the minimum age to buy a handgun (pistol or revolver) at 21.

### Permitless Carry Law

Wyoming adopted a permitless carry law for residents in 2011, allowing residents who qualify for a concealed carry permit to carry without a permit. In 2021, Wyoming expanded that law to cover otherwise qualified non-residents. The state maintains a concealed firearms permit (CFP) for residents seeking reciprocity in other states, and a state permit allows permit holders to forego an otherwise required background check when purchasing a new firearm from a federally licensed dealer.

### Concealed Firearms Permit (CFP)

The Wyoming Attorney General‚Äôs office has the authority to issue permits. To apply for a CFP, contact your local sheriff‚Äôs office, which then forwards your permit application to the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) for review and a background check. Wyoming is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning that if you meet all the objective eligibility criteria, they shall issue the concealed handgun permit.

Permits are valid for five years. However, the state can pursue revocation if a permittee becomes ineligible in the future. The DCI maintains a helpful FAQ section on its website, letting local and out-of-state gun owners know which other states‚Äô permits Wyoming honors and vice-versa.

### Prohibited Locations for Carrying Firearms

Wyoming law includes a list of prohibited locations where carrying a firearm is not allowed, including:

  * Facilities used primarily for law enforcement or by a law enforcement agency
  * Detention facilities, prisons, or jails
  * Courtrooms (unless excepted by the judge)
  * Meetings of governmental entities
  * Meetings of the legislature or its committees
  * School, college, or professional athletic events not related to firearms
  * Places that sell liquor for consumption on premises
  * Elementary and secondary schools
  * College or university facilities (unless with consent of their security)



### Assault Weapons, Ghost Guns, and Private Sales

Wyoming law does not regulate the possession of assault weapons or ghost guns (firearms that can be assembled from a kit or through the use of a 3D printer). It also does not mandate background checks for those purchasing a gun through a private sale. There is no waiting period from the time of purchase to the time of delivery when buying a firearm.

### State Preemption Law

Wyoming has a state preemption law that bans local authorities from passing stricter gun laws than the state. The state also passed a law stating that firearms manufactured and not leaving Wyoming in interstate commerce do not fall under federal regulations, although this law has never been tested in court.

### Relevant Statutes (Laws)

Wyoming‚Äôs gun laws can be found in Wyoming Statutes, Title 6, Chapter 8, Sections 6‚Äì8‚Äì101 through 6‚Äì8‚Äì406, and Title 21, Chapter 8, Section 21‚Äì3‚Äì132:

  * Use or possession of a firearm by a person convicted of certain felony offenses ‚Äî Section 6‚Äì8‚Äì102
  * Wearing or carrying concealed weapons ‚Äî Section 6‚Äì8‚Äì104
  * Regulation of firearms ‚Äî Section 6‚Äì8‚Äì404
  * Possession of firearms on school property ‚Äî Section 21‚Äì3‚Äì132



### Illegal Arms

Wyoming does not prohibit specific firearms but bans the use of fully automatic weapons to take wildlife under its hunting regulations.

### Waiting Period

Wyoming has no waiting period for purchasing a firearm.

### Who May Not Own

Wyoming law states that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a violent felony*
  * Have previously pleaded guilty to or been convicted of committing or attempting to commit a nonviolent felony*
  * *Exceptions apply where they received a pardon or had rights restored under the law.



Federal law states that a person cannot possess a firearm if they:

  * Have been convicted of any felony in any state, territory, or other jurisdiction of the United States.
  * Are a fugitive from justice
  * Are an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance
  * Have been adjudicated to be mentally defective or been committed to any mental institution
  * Are an illegal noncitizen
  * Have been discharged from the military under dishonorable conditions
  * Have renounced U.S. citizenship
  * Are subject to a court order restraining them from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child of an intimate partner
  * Have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence



### License Requirements

Wyoming does not require a person to have a license to own a gun.

### Concealed Carry License Requirements

Wyoming issues concealed carry permits but does not require them for a Wyoming resident or lawful U.S. citizen to carry a concealed firearm. If a resident is eligible for a permit, they may carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Permits are still available for residents who wish to carry a concealed firearm in states that recognize Wyoming permits.

  * Not have been convicted of a misdemeanor violation of the Wyoming Controlled Substances Act or similar laws of any other state or the United States relating to controlled substances within 1 year before applying for the permit
  * Not chronically or habitually use alcohol to the extent that the person‚Äôs normal faculties are impaired
  * Demonstrate familiarity with a firearm through completion of a firearm safety or training course, law enforcement experience, experience competing in organized handgun shooting competitions, or military service
  * Not be currently adjudicated to be legally incompetent
  * Not have been committed to a mental institution



### Machine Gun Laws

Wyoming has no laws prohibiting the ownership or possession of machine guns, except in state game fields or forests. However, federal prohibitions may apply.

### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

Wyoming has few prohibitions against gun possession, but its gun laws do include potential prison time.

  * Possessing a concealed deadly weapon without a permit or other exception is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in prison, a fine of $750, or both. A second or subsequent offense is a felony, punishable by up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $2,000, or both.
  * Possessing a firearm while having a previous violent felony conviction is a felony, punishable by up to three years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.
