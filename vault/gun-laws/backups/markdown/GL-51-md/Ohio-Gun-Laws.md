### Federal and State Gun Control Laws: An Overview

Federal and state gun control laws place limits on the purchase, use, and possession of firearms throughout the country, with state laws varying considerably. With limited gun control legislation emerging from a divided Congress, state legislators must balance concerns about gun violence with the rights of law-abiding gun owners. The majority of Ohio lawmakers favor gun rights over increased regulation, resulting in Ohio gun laws containing fewer restrictions compared to other states.

A major limitation on gun restrictions appears in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the right to bear arms as an individual right to own guns for self-defense and other lawful reasons. In assessing the constitutionality of laws that restrict the possession of firearms, the focus is on whether the law is consistent with regulations of guns at the time of the Constitution‚Äôs adoption.

### Ohio Gun Control Laws

Ohio gun control laws prohibit certain weapons while restricting gun purchases and ownership by certain individuals. For instance, Ohio prohibits the possession of:

  * Sawed-off shotguns
  * Zip guns, which are improvised and often dangerous firearms
  * Certain weapons and ammunition designed for military use



The state has not banned assault weapons or sought to regulate so-called undetectable firearms known as ‚Äúghost guns.‚Äù

#### Prohibited Persons

Under Ohio law, the following cannot own or possess firearms:

  * Certain convicted felons
  * Individuals with substance abuse problems
  * Those found mentally incompetent



Ohio does not require a waiting period prior to purchasing a gun. If you purchase a gun from a federally licensed dealer, they will run a criminal background check using the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) before delivering the firearm. If you buy from a private seller or unlicensed dealer, you are not required to undergo a criminal background check to verify whether you fall under a firearm prohibition.

Ohio law does not provide a minimum age for possessing a firearm. Those under 18 cannot legally purchase a firearm, and persons under 21 cannot legally purchase a handgun, with exceptions for police officers and active-duty military who are at least 18.

### Ohio Concealed Carry Laws

In 2022, the Ohio General Assembly passed a permitless carry law. Under this law, a qualifying adult is not required to complete firearms training or obtain a concealed handgun license (CHL) to carry a concealed handgun in the state.

A qualifying adult must be 21 years of age or older, not prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or federal law, and otherwise meet the criteria to obtain a CHL. Whether you are an Ohio resident or a non-resident working in Ohio, you file your license application with your local sheriff‚Äôs office or the sheriff of a neighboring county.

Ohio maintains its concealed carry permit process to assist permit-holders traveling to states that have a reciprocity agreement with Ohio.

Even with laws that permit open or concealed carry of firearms, state law prohibits bringing guns into certain locations. States vary in what locations are off-limits. Private property owners can ban guns from their property but must provide signage. In Ohio, the law prohibits guns in the following locations under most circumstances:

  * Sheriff, highway patrol, and police stations
  * Premises controlled by the Ohio Attorney General‚Äôs Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI)
  * State correctional facilities, jails, workhouses, and other detention facilities
  * Restricted areas of airports
  * Institutions governed by state mental health and addiction or developmental disability services
  * School safety zones
  * Courthouses and courtrooms
  * Permit D liquor establishments
  * Government buildings of the state (including the Statehouse and Capitol in Columbus) and its political subdivisions
  * Premises owned or leased by public or private colleges and universities
  * Places of worship
  * Locations prohibited under federal law



Ohio bans transporting or having a loaded gun in a motor vehicle in a manner that an operator or passenger can access it without leaving the vehicle. There are several exceptions, including one for those with a valid CHL who are not in a prohibited location.
