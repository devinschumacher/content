### Gun Control Laws in Oregon: Overview

State gun laws are usually more comprehensive than federal law. Still, state laws that regulate the purchase and use of guns vary quite a bit from state to state, often reflecting regional traditions and attitudes toward guns. Some states require a permit for buying a gun or include a waiting period for a background check. Other states have very few restrictions.

Oregon does not ban assault weapons. The open carry of firearms is legal, but some restrictions are in sensitive locations and safety concerns in larger cities. The state requires a concealed carry permit for handguns.

In 2022, Oregon voters narrowly passed Measure 114, a gun safety law. This ballot measure included a ban on high-capacity magazines and the creation of a firearm purchase permit. The new law has faced legal challenges in state and federal courts.

### Oregon Concealed Handgun License

If you want to carry a concealed handgun in the state of Oregon, you need to get a concealed handgun license (CHL). The law has exceptions for those who only conceal a pistol at their homes or places of business.

State law has objective criteria you must meet to get a CHL. This includes passing a criminal background check proving that you are not legally prohibited from having a firearm.

You file your application with your local county sheriff. You must give your fingerprints and two references as part of the application process. The sheriff’s office will photograph you as well. You must be 21 or older to apply. You also must show competence with the handgun — usually by proof you completed a firearms safety course. There are no waiting periods under Oregon law. So, once you meet all the criteria, the state will issue you a license.

CHL holders have limited location restrictions. For example, even with a concealed weapons permit, you can’t take a gun into a courthouse or into the secure area of a correctional facility or a commercial airport.

Oregon has no reciprocity law. So, the sheriff is not likely to recognize a concealed carry license from out of state. If you have concerns or questions about that, get answers before you travel to Oregon with a firearm.

### Ban on Undetectable Firearms

In 2021, state lawmakers passed a law prohibiting so-called “ghost guns,” firearms that a metal detector can’t detect. The law defines an undetectable firearm as one that:

  * Was constructed or produced entirely of nonmetal substances (including by 3D printing)
  * Is not detectable by a walk-through metal detector after removal of grips, stocks, and magazines
  * Includes a major component that does not generate an accurate image in X-ray devices commonly used at airports



The law also bans firearms without a serial number and unfinished frames and receivers.

### Open Carry Allowed?

It depends. In general, open carry of firearms is allowed in Oregon. But local jurisdictions can ban the carry of firearms in public places by persons who do not hold a CHL or who are not otherwise authorized (like police officers). For example, see Multnomah County Ordinance 15.064.
