### Vermont Gun Law Overview

### Permits and Registration

  * Vermont does not require permits to purchase firearms or registration of guns and their owners. Under Vermont firearm laws, it is not necessary to have a permit to conceal and carry a weapon.



### Dealer Requirements

  * All dealers must keep records of all sales of new and used handguns. These records must include the weapon’s make, name, model, caliber, and manufacturer’s serial number, as well as the purchaser’s name, address, occupation, age, height, weight, and hair and eye color. The records must be kept on file and on location for at least six years and made available to the proper authorities if requested.



### Firearm Possession

  * Possession of a firearm is not contingent on obtaining permits or licenses. However, no one under the age of 16 may possess a firearm unless they have permission from a parent or legal guardian. It is illegal to possess a zip gun, defined as a homemade firearm or weapon.



### Zip Guns

  * Zip guns, which can be disguised as other objects, are prohibited and considered illegal in Vermont. This law ensures that while open carry and concealed carry are permitted without a permit, the possession of such disguised weapons is controlled.



### Machine Guns and Automatic Weapons

  * Vermont does not impose regulations on machine guns or automatic weapons as long as they comply with federal laws.
