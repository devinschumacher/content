### Texas Gun Laws

### Permitless Carry in Texas

In 2021, the Texas legislature passed a new law approving permitless carry, also known as constitutional carry. Signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, this law allows a person who does not have a concealed carry license to carry a gun in public, provided they are not prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm.

### Comparison with Other States

In other states, including neighboring New Mexico and Colorado, the law requires a person to apply for a license, submit their fingerprints, complete firearms safety training, and pass a background check before the state authorizes them to carry a concealed weapon. In states like Texas, people operate on the honor system. If they engage in the carrying of firearms when it‚Äôs illegal, they may face prosecution at a later date.

### Handgun Licensing Program

Texas still maintains its handgun licensing program through the Texas Department of Public Safety. One benefit of getting the state‚Äôs license to carry (LTC) permit relates to reciprocity agreements with other states. Eligibility requirements are outlined below.

### Firearms Prohibited Locations

Even with permitless carry, Texans must adhere to laws that ban firearms in certain public places. Some locations where guns are prohibited include:

  * Schools, colleges, and universities
  * Polling places (while voting is taking place)
  * Courts and court offices
  * Racetracks
  * Secure areas of an airport
  * Correctional facilities
  * Certain businesses that serve alcohol
  * Hospitals and nursing facilities
  * Mental hospitals
  * Amusement parks
  * Government meeting rooms



Certain exceptions may apply for active-duty military and law enforcement officers. Private property owners can also ban firearms on their premises, but they may need to place signage to notify customers or visitors.

#### Who May Not Own Firearms

Texas prohibits firearm possession under the following circumstances:

  * A person convicted of a felony may not have a firearm before the fifth anniversary of their release from confinement or supervision under community supervision, parole, or mandatory supervision. After five years, a person convicted of a felony may only possess a firearm at their living premises.

#### License Required

No. Texas does not require a license to own a firearm.

#### Concealed Carry License Required

No. Texas does not require that a person first get a license to carry (LTC) permit before carrying a concealed firearm. But, it remains against the law for a prohibited person to possess or carry a firearm.

#### Open Carry Allowed

Texas generally allows the open carry of long guns throughout the state. However, the crime of disorderly conduct prohibits displaying any firearm in a public place in a ‚Äúmanner calculated to alarm.‚Äù

Open carry of handguns is allowed under certain circumstances. If not otherwise prohibited from firearm possession, you may carry a handgun in a public place if it remains concealed or holstered.

There is an exception for college campuses. Under Texas‚Äô campus carry laws, a person with a valid LTC permit may carry a concealed firearm onto a college campus. However, college boards have the right to pass restrictions on such carrying of firearms. Public institutions may restrict but can‚Äôt outright ban permit holders from carrying firearms on campus. Private institutions may restrict and even ban permit holders from carrying firearms on campus.

### Eligibility for a Concealed Carry License

In Texas, a person is eligible for a license to carry (LTC) permit if they:

  * Are a legal resident of Texas for the six months preceding the application date or are eligible for a nonresident license
  * Are at least 21 years old (with certain exceptions for those ages 18‚Äì20)
  * Have not been convicted of a felony
  * Are not charged with a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or an equivalent offense, disorderly conduct, or a felony
  * Are not a fugitive from justice for a felony or a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense
  * Are not a chemically dependent person
  * Are not incapable of exercising sound judgment on the proper use and storage of a handgun (which may include evidence of mental illness, incompetency, or insanity)
  * Have not, in the five years preceding the date of application, been convicted of a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense or disorderly conduct
  * Are fully qualified under applicable federal and state law to buy a handgun
  * Have not been finally determined delinquent in making a child support payment
  * Have not been finally determined delinquent in the payment of taxes
  * Are not restricted under a court protective order or subject to a restraining order affecting the spousal relationship other than a restraining order solely affecting property interests
  * Have not, in the 10 years preceding the date of application, been adjudicated as having engaged in delinquent conduct violating a penal law of the grade of felony
  * Have not made any material misrepresentation or failed to disclose any material fact in an application submitted pursuant to Section 411.174



 _Note that a federal court has ruled that the restriction for handgun possession only to those 21 years of age and older violates the Second Amendment. The state has withdrawn its appeal of this ruling._

### Machine Gun Laws

Possessing, manufacturing, transporting, repairing, or selling a machine gun is illegal in Texas unless the machine gun is registered in compliance with federal law.

### Penalties for Illegal Firearm Possession

In Texas, illegal firearm possession can be a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the type of weapon and where the weapon is.

  * Unlawful carrying of a handgun without a license is, under most circumstances, a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail, a fine of up to $4,000, or both.
  * Unlawful carrying of a handgun without a license at a place where alcohol is sold is a felony of the third degree, punishable by two to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.
  * Possession of an illegal firearm is a felony of the third degree, punishable by two to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.
  * Unlawful possession of a firearm after a felony conviction is a felony of the third degree, punishable by two to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.
  * Possession of a firearm on a property with a conspicuously posted sign notifying that firearms are prohibited on the premises is a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $200. However, it can become a Class A misdemeanor when the person refuses to leave. This law has exceptions and defenses that may apply.



### Penalties for Illegal Possession on or Near School Grounds

It is illegal to intentionally or knowingly have a firearm on school grounds, school buses, or property where there is a school activity. Exceptions may apply related to storage and motor vehicle rules for a carrier with a valid handgun license or when the school‚Äôs written regulations allow a person to have a weapon. Illegal possession on school grounds is a felony of the third degree, punishable by two to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.

### Universal Background Checks

No. Texas law does not require a criminal background check in any firearms transactions.

### Stand Your Ground Law

Yes. Texas self-defense law does not require a person to retreat before using appropriate force (even deadly force) to defend themselves against an attack as long as the person is in a place they may legally be, did not provoke the attack, and is not engaged in criminal conduct. See Penal Code Sections 9.31 and 9.32.
