Utah’s gun laws have evolved over the past decade, reflecting the state’s commitment to responsible firearm ownership and community safety. These changes demonstrate Utah’s proactive approach to firearm regulation. As the state continues to adapt its laws, it remains crucial for stakeholders, policymakers, and the public to engage in informed discussions that prioritize individual rights while maintaining community security.

### Utah Gun Law Overview

### Permit to Purchase Firearms

  * No permit is required to purchase firearms in Utah. Authorized gun dealers must conduct instant background checks approved by the Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI). A fee of $7.50 is charged to the buyer for the cost of the background check.
  * Individuals with a valid license for a concealed firearm are exempt from the background check and fee if the license is presented at the time of sale.



### Firearm Possession Criteria

  * No permit or license is required to possess firearms. However, certain restrictions apply:
  * No one with felony convictions may possess a firearm.
  * Individuals unlawfully possessing a weapon and intentionally possessing a controlled substance.
  * Illegal residents of the United States.
  * Individuals found guilty of a felony charge by reason of insanity.
  * Individuals dishonorably discharged from the military or armed forces.
  * Individuals under parole of a “secure facility.”



### Firearms in Schools

  * It is illegal to possess a firearm on or around school premises. Authorized concealed firearm carriers and appropriate law enforcement officials are exempt from this statute.



### Concealed Carry

  * Concealed carry is allowed for those with the appropriate permit. Applicants must be at least 21 years of age and pass a background check. Applicants with felony, alcohol, drug, or violent crime convictions are disqualified.
  * Applicants must provide a copy of their driver’s license, a recent color passport photo, and obtain a Weapons Familiarity Certification from a course issued by the BCI.
  * The permit fee is $65.25, and it is valid for five years. Utah recognizes concealed carry permits from other states if the permit is carried while carrying the weapon.



### Restrictions on Concealed Weapons

  * Concealed weapons are not permitted in secure areas, including schools, courthouses, and airports. Certain facilities may impose additional restrictions and must designate secure areas to store weapons.
