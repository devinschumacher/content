### Overview of New Hampshire Gun Laws

### General Regulations

Like its neighbors, Vermont and Maine, New Hampshire has very liberal gun control laws. However, New Hampshire‚Äôs laws are unique in their level of leniency. Most states with minimal gun control do not require a permit or license to purchase or possess a handgun or rifle, and New Hampshire follows this trend. The only restrictions on licenses or permits typically pertain to carrying a concealed weapon.

### Handgun and Firearm Purchases

  * New Hampshire does not require a permit or license to possess or purchase any type of firearm, and registration is also unnecessary.
  * A concealed handgun does not generally require a permit, but specific licenses are needed in certain situations.
  * It is illegal to carry a loaded handgun concealed on oneself or in a vehicle unless the handgun is openly carried, unloaded, or locked in a vehicle compartment. Any other form of concealment requires a license from the chief of police, who will grant the right to conceal if a ‚Äúproper purpose‚Äù is demonstrated. Proper purposes include hunting, target shooting, self-defense, or a reasonable fear for one‚Äôs life or property.

### Regulation of Dealers and Sellers

  * New Hampshire has strict policies regarding firearm dealers and suppliers, due to its proximity to Canada and susceptibility to gun trafficking.
  * Unlike many states with lenient gun laws, New Hampshire requires state licenses for all firearm sellers and distributors.
  * Random police inspections of gun shops are allowed, though record keeping is not regulated.
  * There are no limits on bulk purchases, ammunition regulations, or magazine sizes. Background checks, fingerprints, ballistic filing, and even safety provisions for children are all neglected under New Hampshire gun law.

### Crime and Safety Concerns

  * Federal law governs the registration and purchase of machine guns, as New Hampshire law does not cover these areas.
  * Despite loose gun laws, New Hampshire consistently ranks as one of the safest states in the United States. However, there is still a need for more progressive laws to curb gun trafficking and the establishment of illegal gun markets.



New Hampshire‚Äôs gun laws reflect a balance between the state‚Äôs cultural context and the ongoing debates about public safety. While the state has made significant strides in regulation, the unique challenges posed by high tourism and contrasting urban and rural areas continue to shape its approach to gun control.
