### Additional Information on Arkansas Gun Laws

Arkansas does not require registration of shotguns, rifles, or handguns, except for machine guns, which must be registered under federal and state law. Arkansas defines a machine gun as a weapon capable of discharging five shots automatically or semi-automatically with a single action on the trigger.

Arkansas does not require a state permit for the purchase or possession of firearms. Individuals must be at least 18 years old to purchase firearms, with minors needing parental or guardian consent.

Possession of firearms is restricted under Arkansas law, prohibiting felons, those adjudicated mentally unfit, or involuntarily committed to a mental institution from possessing firearms. Exceptions include private property, authorized duties in law enforcement or military service, transportation, and supervised minors engaged in lawful activities.

Arkansas permits concealed carry of handguns with a license. Applicants must be at least 21 years old, an Arkansas resident for over a year, pass background checks, and meet other eligibility criteria.

Licensed concealed carry holders are prohibited from certain public places like law enforcement facilities, schools, and establishments serving alcohol for on-premises consumption, except in restaurants.
