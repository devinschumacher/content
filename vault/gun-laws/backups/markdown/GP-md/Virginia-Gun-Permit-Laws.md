[Wyoming](https://medium.com/shooting-safety-firearm-laws/wyoming-concealed-carry-gun-permit-laws-125f8ce50786)

#### Possession of Firearms

  * **Restrictions** : Possession and sale of firearms are restricted for certain individuals deemed unqualified by state law, including those with felony convictions, individuals under the age of 29 convicted of a crime as a minor that would constitute a felony if charged as an adult, and individuals acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity.
  * **Minors** : Minors under the age of 12 may only use a firearm under the direct supervision of an adult.
  * **Specific Restrictions** : Virginia restricts semi-automatic rifles with a folding stock capable of holding more than 12 rounds, making it illegal to sell, transport, or possess such a shotgun. Illegal aliens are also prohibited from possessing, buying, or transporting a firearm.



#### Carrying Firearms

  * **Concealed Carry** : The carrying of a concealed weapon is allowed only by a concealed handgun permit. Applicants must submit their application in writing to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the appropriate county, be at least 21 years of age, and be legally deemed able to possess a firearm. Non-residents can also obtain a permit for a fee of $100, while residents pay $50. Individuals disqualified from applying for a concealed handgun permit include those with two or more misdemeanor convictions in the past five years, individuals with convictions for battery, assault, sexual battery, or any kind of assault in the past three years, individuals with a history of mental illness or substance abuse, and individuals with a history of selling marijuana or controlled substances.
  * **Open Carry** : Open carry of a handgun is legal in Virginia without a permit, as long as the weapon is in plain sight. The minimum age for open carry is 18 years. Open carry in a vehicle is also permitted. It is illegal to conceal carry a handgun in establishments where alcohol is served for consumption on the premises, so many individuals carry the weapon openly in such establishments to avoid breaking the concealed carry statute.



#### Specific Weapon Restrictions

  * **Machine Guns** : Machine guns are not considered illegal as long as they are registered according to federal regulations, and their possession is not deemed for an aggressive or offensive purpose. Failure to register a machine gun with the proper authorities constitutes such a purpose.
  * **Sawed-Off Shotguns** : Sawed-off shotguns are illegal unless rendered useless and incapable of being discharged, with possession for any other purpose than education or keepsake being illegal. A sawed-off shotgun is defined as a rifle with a barrel less than 16 inches or an overall length of less than 26 inches.



Virginia‚Äôs gun laws reflect a balance between the rights of individuals to bear arms and the necessity of ensuring public safety. Continuous updates and refinements to these laws are crucial in addressing the needs and concerns of all stakeholders. Residents must stay informed about these regulations, and policymakers should engage in ongoing discussions to uphold both individual rights and community security.
