### 2023 — Minimum Age for Handgun Purchase Raised

Alaska raises the minimum age for purchasing handguns from 18 to 21 years old, aligning with federal age restrictions.

### 2023 — Enhanced Firearm Storage Requirements

Legislation promotes responsible firearm storage to prevent unauthorized access by minors.

### 2023 — Stricter Penalties for Gun Trafficking

Alaska increases penalties for gun trafficking and straw purchases to deter illegal firearms distribution.

Alaska’s evolving gun laws demonstrate a commitment to addressing safety while respecting Second Amendment rights. From constitutional carry and background check exemptions to “Stand Your Ground” and “Red Flag” laws, these changes reflect a nuanced approach to firearm regulation. As Alaska continues to adapt its legal framework, ongoing dialogue among lawmakers, citizens, and advocates remains crucial to maintaining a balanced approach to gun rights and community safety.

### Additional Information on Alaska Gun Laws

While Alaska gun laws do not require registration or permits for rifles, shotguns, or handguns, they adhere to federal guidelines and maintain unique state provisions:

  * **Minimum age for firearm purchase is 18, with restrictions on sales to felony convicts and individuals under the influence.**
  * **Possession on school grounds and other specified public places is prohibited without permission.**
  * **Concealed carry of handguns is allowed without a permit for those over 21, with optional permits available for reciprocity in other states.**



These regulations ensure firearms are handled responsibly while upholding Alaskans’ rights under state and federal law.
