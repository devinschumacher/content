### 2023 — Firearm Storage Recommendations

Proposed legislation aims to encourage responsible firearm storage practices through educational campaigns and voluntary guidelines.

Idaho’s gun laws have evolved in the past decade, reflecting the state’s dedication to upholding Second Amendment rights while fostering responsible firearm ownership. From “Constitutional Carry” to enhanced background checks and discussions on “red flag” laws, these changes underscore Idaho’s commitment to balancing individual liberties with community safety. As the state continues to navigate the landscape of firearm regulation, it remains crucial for stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens to engage in informed discussions that preserve both individual freedoms and the well-being of the community.

**Key Points of Idaho Gun Laws:**

**No Registration or Licensing:** Idaho does not require the registration of firearms or licensing of firearm owners.

**Permitless Purchase:** Individuals seeking to purchase handguns do not need to acquire a permit. Firearms can be purchased at certified dealers by individuals aged 18 or older, subject to a background check through the National Instant Check System (NICS).

**Minors and Firearms:** Minors under 18 can purchase firearms only with written consent from a parent or legal guardian. It is illegal to provide minors under 16 with ammunition, except for rounds used in shotguns or rifles up to a .22 caliber, with written consent from a parent or guardian.

**Concealed Carry:** A concealed weapon is defined as one carried on a person or in an easily accessible container. To carry concealed, individuals must be over 21 and legal residents of the U.S. Licenses require fingerprinting and background checks, and are issued by the Idaho State Police. Individuals between 18–21 may be granted licenses if they demonstrate a necessity to carry a concealed weapon.

**Exemptions and Restrictions:** Concealed weapons licenses are not required outside city or town limits. However, individuals with felony convictions or those with a history of drug abuse, dishonorable military discharge, or violent misdemeanors within the past three years are prohibited from obtaining a license.

**Public Carrying Restrictions:** Carrying a loaded firearm in public without a proper permit is generally illegal, except for law enforcement, military personnel, mail carriers, and other state-employed individuals who require firearms for their duties.

Idaho’s proactive approach to firearm regulation demonstrates a dedication to responsible gun ownership and public safety. As the state continues to refine its laws, ongoing engagement and discussion among stakeholders, policymakers, and citizens will be vital to maintaining this balance.
