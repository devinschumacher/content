### Additional Details on California Gun Laws

California requires registration of handguns and firearms classified as ‚Äúassault weapons,‚Äù with law enforcement agencies recording all purchases within these categories. New residents must register firearms within 60 days of moving to the state, ensuring comprehensive oversight.

Purchasing firearms in California involves stringent guidelines. Applicants must provide valid identification and proof of residency, pass a written test administered by the California Department of Justice, and submit to a thorough background check. A mandatory 10-day waiting period follows approval, during which the firearm must be registered upon purchase. Individuals may only purchase one firearm within a 30-day period, and failure to retrieve the purchased firearm within 30 days necessitates repeating the entire process.

Firearm possession is restricted to individuals without felony convictions, mental health issues, or histories of violent misdemeanors. Minors are prohibited from possessing handguns, except under direct parental supervision for lawful activities. Loaded firearms in public are strictly forbidden, except in specific circumstances such as hunting or at shooting ranges.

California permits concealed carry with a license, which requires applicants to meet age, residency, and eligibility criteria, including passing a background check. Open carry of firearms at public demonstrations is prohibited to prevent potential conflicts.

Assault weapons are subject to specific regulations, including restrictions on sale, transfer, and possession. Unregistered assault weapons must be relinquished, with exceptions for private property, authorized shooting clubs, or lawful transfer out of state. Restrictions on magazine capacities further enhance public safety measures against potential firearm misuse.
