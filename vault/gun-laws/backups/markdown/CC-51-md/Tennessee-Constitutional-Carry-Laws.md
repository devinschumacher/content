### The Second Amendment and State Regulations

The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of U.S. citizens to own firearms, but individual states have the authority to establish regulations governing the purchase and carrying of guns. Tennesseeâ€™s gun control laws are relatively moderate compared to some states, incorporating background checks for gun purchases from licensed dealers and several other specified restrictions.
