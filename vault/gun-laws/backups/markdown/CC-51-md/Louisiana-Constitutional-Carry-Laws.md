### Louisiana Gun Control Laws

Louisiana‚Äôs gun control laws are among the least restrictive in the U.S. There is no requirement for a license or permit to own a firearm, and no state restrictions on assault weapons or large-capacity magazines.

### Universal Background Checks

Universal background checks are not required for gun purchases. Federal law mandates background checks for purchases through federally licensed dealers, but private sales are exempt.

### State Constitution

Gun control efforts consider the interests of gun owners, as Louisiana is popular for outdoor activities like hunting and fishing. The state constitution affirms: ‚ÄúThe right of each citizen to keep and bear arms is fundamental and shall not be infringed. Any restriction on this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny.‚Äù

The Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that the right to bear arms is not absolute, upholding restrictions on felons and juveniles possessing firearms, as well as the state‚Äôs concealed carry law, citing a compelling state interest.

### Waiting Period

There is no waiting period for gun purchases in Louisiana. However, specific requirements exist for obtaining a concealed carry permit. Applicants must be state residents, at least 21 years old, and not prohibited from firearm possession under state or federal law. Louisiana is a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning permits will be issued if criteria are met. The Louisiana State Police provide application details.

### Restrictions on Carrying Firearms

Firearms, whether concealed or open, are restricted in the following locations:

  * Law enforcement offices, stations, or buildings
  * Prisons, jails, or detention facilities
  * Courthouses or courtrooms
  * Public buildings used for governmental meetings
  * The state capitol building
  * Prohibited areas within airport facilities
  * Places of worship, unless authorized
  * Schools, campuses, or buses
  * Polling places
  * Parades or demonstrations with government permits
  * Establishments licensed to sell alcohol
  * Private residences, unless authorized by the resident



Efforts to pass a broad permitless carry law were unsuccessful in 2022. However, permitless carry was approved for active-duty military and veterans who are Louisiana residents (See L.R.S. 14:95 M).

### Preemption Statute

Louisiana law includes a preemption statute that generally prevents cities like Baton Rouge and New Orleans from enacting stricter gun laws than those at the state level.
