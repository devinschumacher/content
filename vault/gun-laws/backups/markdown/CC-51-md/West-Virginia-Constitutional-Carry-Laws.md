### Gun Control and Gun Violence in West Virginia

The issue of gun control and gun violence remains controversial in American politics today. State gun control laws vary greatly. Some states implement strict regulations to enhance gun safety and reduce gun violence, while others favor limited gun laws, presenting law-abiding gun owners as the solution to gun crime. West Virginia strikes a balance in these debates, favoring gun rights.

Understanding firearms law often begins with the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. Many state constitutions do the same. Recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court affirm that citizens have an individual right to own guns for self-defense and other lawful purposes, extending this right from the home into the public sphere.

However, this right is not absolute. The Court has articulated a historical test for reviewing whether a state or federal gun regulation overly burdens the right to bear arms.

### Federal Firearms Law

Under federal law, Congress regulates the interstate commerce of firearms. It has established laws to control certain dangerous weapons like machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, and sawed-off rifles. It also mandates federal licensing of gun dealers and sets prohibitions for persons who cannot possess firearms. Through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), it helps keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them, such as convicted felons.

### West Virginia Gun Laws

West Virginia‚Äôs license plates carry the state slogan ‚ÄúWild, Wonderful,‚Äù reflecting an emphasis on outdoor adventures. State law favors gun rights for hunting, recreational use, and self-defense. As a result, West Virginia‚Äôs firearm laws lack many restrictions found in other states.

For example, no permit is required to purchase firearms, and the state does not mandate firearm registration. There are no state bans on assault weapons, nor is there a waiting period from purchase to delivery of firearms.

State law does not provide for universal background checks. If you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, they will run a NICS check. If you buy a gun through a private sale, there is no requirement for a background check.

In 2016, West Virginia adopted a permitless carry law for those at least 21 years old. Also known as constitutional carry, these laws allow citizens who are not otherwise prohibited from holding a concealed handgun license (CHL) to carry a handgun without a permit.

A CHL only covers the carrying of a pistol or revolver. Citizens can still apply for a concealed carry permit through their county sheriff‚Äôs office, often for reciprocity, allowing them to carry concealed handguns in other states.

At 18 years old, a person can apply for a provisional CHL. At 21, a person can get a standard CHL. The application forms are prepared by the Superintendent of the West Virginia State Police. The crime of carrying a concealed handgun without a permit does not apply to those between 18 and 21 who meet certain exceptions:

  * Carrying the handgun on their premises
  * Transporting the handgun after purchase to home, business, or for repair
  * While hunting or traveling to or from hunting
  * Members of organized target shooting clubs
  * Law enforcement officers or officials (including federal law enforcement)
  * Certain corrections officials
  * Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, reserve, or National Guard
  * Nonresidents with a valid concealed carry permit from a state recognized by West Virginia
  * Parole officers



### Prohibited Locations for Firearms

In West Virginia, gun owners must be aware that they may not take a firearm into the following places:

  * Primary and secondary schools
  * The State Capitol Complex in Charleston
  * Private real property where firearms are prohibited by the owner
  * Premises of a court of law
  * Federal government buildings, including secure areas of airports
  * Jails, detention facilities, and state correctional institutions
  * Certain buildings or areas limited by a municipality‚Äôs local code



One place where firearms may become more common is on college campuses. In July 2024, the state‚Äôs new Campus Self-Defense Act will take effect, allowing those with a valid concealed carry license to bring handguns onto public college and university campuses. The law, supported by the National Rifle Association (NRA), was opposed by the presidents of the state‚Äôs five major institutions, including West Virginia University and Marshall University.

  * **Unlawful possession of a firearm by a prohibited person:** Misdemeanor, punishable by 90 days to one year in jail, a fine of $100-$1,000, or both. If the prohibited person is carrying the firearm concealed: Felony, punishable by up to three years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.
  * **Unlawful possession of a firearm by a prohibited person convicted of a felony crime of violence, a felony sexual offense, or certain felony controlled-substance offenses:** Felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000, or both. If the prohibited person is carrying the firearm concealed: Felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.
  * **Unlawful possession of a machine gun:** Misdemeanor, punishable by 90 days to one year in jail, a fine of $1,000 to $5,000, or both.



### Penalties for Illegal Possession on or Near School Grounds

  * On a school bus
  * On the grounds of any primary or secondary educational facility
  * At school-sponsored functions



There are several exceptions. A violation of this law is a felony, punishable by two to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.

### Red Flag Law?

No. West Virginia enacted a law in 2021 that provides that no court has the authority to issue an order depriving a citizen of the state of their right to possess firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition under any red flag law.

### Universal Background Checks?

No. West Virginia does not require that private gun sales transactions include a criminal background check.

### Stand Your Ground Law?

Yes. West Virginia law provides that a person who is not engaging in criminal activity and is in a place they have a legal right to be can use reasonable and proportionate force against an attacker. They may use deadly force without a duty to retreat if they reasonably believe that they or another person is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm from which they can only be saved by the use of deadly force. State law also adopts the Castle doctrine, requiring no retreat from the defense of your home from an intruder.

### Note

State laws are always subject to change through the passage of new legislation, rulings in higher courts that include federal decisions, ballot initiatives, and other means. While we strive to provide the most current information available, please consult an attorney or conduct your own legal research to verify the status of any state law(s) you are reviewing.

Navigating gun laws at the federal and state levels can be confusing. Neighboring states like Ohio and Pennsylvania do not have identical gun laws, including those governing concealed firearms. If you have questions, consider seeking legal advice. Whether you‚Äôve been charged with violating the law or are hoping to get your gun rights restored, you can speak to an experienced local criminal defense lawyer.
