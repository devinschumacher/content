### Gun Violence Prevention Efforts

In 2012, twenty children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in the deadliest elementary school shooting in U.S. history. Since then, efforts to prevent gun violence and enhance gun safety have increased significantly.

### Connecticutâ€™s Gun Laws

In 2013, Connecticut enacted an assault weapons ban and limited large-capacity magazines. The state expanded background check regulations and gun permit requirements. The definition of an assault weapon now includes the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle, modeled after the M16. The law also imposes a 10-round limit on magazine capacity. Connecticutâ€™s gun control measures have withstood several legal challenges.

### State Administration

The Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection (DESPP) oversees Connecticut gun laws. The Connecticut State Police, Special Licensing and Firearms Unit (SLFU), manages permits for handguns and long guns, regulates all retail and private sales, maintains registries of machine guns and assault weapons, and conducts background checks for purchases and transfers.

### Compliance with Federal and State Laws

All gun purchases and transfers in Connecticut must comply with federal and state law restrictions.

### 2023 Gun Safety Legislation

In 2023, Governor Ned Lamont signed new legislation to strengthen gun safety regulations. The law bans open carry in most situations and raises the minimum age to purchase certain semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21, aligning with handgun requirements.

The sale of ghost gun assembly kits, which allow individuals to assemble untraceable firearms without serial numbers, is banned. Sellers of pistols must provide a trigger lock or similar device, and gun owners are required to safely store firearms unless they are in immediate possession.

### Gun Dealer Requirements

Anyone selling ten or more firearms in a calendar year is considered a gun dealer. Along with federally licensed dealers, they must obtain a state permit for sales from their local police chief or another executive officer.

### Relevant Statutes
