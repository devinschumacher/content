### Maryland Gun Control Laws

Gun control laws in the U.S. are controversial, balancing public safety and individual rights. Maryland has stricter gun laws compared to many states, including an assault weapons ban passed in 2013 after the Sandy Hook shooting.

### Maryland Gun Control Laws

Marylandâ€™s comprehensive gun regulations address the purchase, possession, use, and carry of firearms. The laws restrict who can own guns and ban certain firearms and accessories. Individuals under 21 cannot possess a handgun or assault weapon, and those under 18 cannot purchase long guns or ammunition. Convicted felons and those deemed mentally incompetent are also prohibited from possessing firearms.

In 2018, Maryland enacted a red flag law, allowing courts to remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat by law enforcement or family members.

### Maryland Permit Laws

To purchase a handgun or assault weapon, individuals must be at least 21 and complete a firearms safety course, obtaining a Handgun Qualification License (HQL). The Maryland State Police oversee the permit process, requiring background checks for all transactions, including private sales. Gun dealers must be licensed.

Carrying a handgun, either concealed or open, requires a permit, limited to those 21 and older. Without a permit, carrying is restricted to personal residences, owned land, or places of business.

### Location Prohibitions

Maryland law prohibits firearms in:

  * Areas for children and vulnerable adults (schools, preschools)
  * Public infrastructure and government buildings (government, university buildings, polling locations)
  * Special areas (stadiums, museums, amusement parks, racetracks, establishments serving alcohol or cannabis)
  * Private property open to the public without explicit permission
  * Public demonstrations or within 1,000 feet of them when law enforcement has provided notice



### Preemption Law

Maryland state law generally preempts local firearm regulations, but exceptions exist. Local governments can regulate firearm use involving minors and non-range shooting discharges. Cities like Baltimore and Annapolis can regulate gun-related activities near public areas such as parks, schools, and churches.
