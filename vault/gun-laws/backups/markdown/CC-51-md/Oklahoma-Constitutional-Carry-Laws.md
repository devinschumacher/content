### Overview of Federal and State Gun Control Laws

Both state and federal laws play crucial roles in regulating firearms and ammunition, covering aspects from manufacture and purchase to possession and use. These laws aim to balance public safety concerns with the constitutional rights of individuals to own and use firearms for lawful purposes like self-defense.

Federal laws oversee firearm manufacturing and licensing for gun dealers, impose restrictions on owning dangerous weapons, and identify categories of individuals prohibited from possessing firearms, such as convicted felons and those convicted of domestic violence.

The enforcement of federal laws is carried out by agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established by Congress to aid law enforcement agencies in preventing firearms from falling into the hands of individuals not legally allowed to possess them.

Each state also sets its own regulations on purchasing and using firearms under its jurisdiction. These laws must align with the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, safeguarding the right to bear arms for lawful purposes.

### Oklahoma Gun Laws Overview

Oklahoma is known for its favorable stance on gun ownership, with laws designed to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to possess and carry firearms. The state has refrained from introducing new gun control measures in response to rising firearm violence, instead expanding gun rights in recent years.

In Oklahoma, there is no requirement for a license or permit to purchase a firearm, and no waiting period is mandated following a purchase. Purchases from licensed dealers require a federal criminal background check, but private transactions do not necessitate such checks.

While assault weapons are not banned, Oklahoma prohibits certain dangerous weapons and ammunition. For instance, state law prohibits possession of sawed-off shotguns or rifles unless registered under federal law. It also prohibits using restricted bullets designed to penetrate body armor, imposing additional penalties for wearing body armor during the commission of a crime.

State law restricts firearm possession for convicted felons, individuals illegally present in the U.S., those under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and those adjudicated mentally incompetent. Minors under 18 years old generally cannot possess firearms unless participating in specified activities under adult supervision.

### Oklahoma Carry Laws

Oklahoma has enacted laws that ease restrictions on both concealed and open carry of firearms in recent years.

In 2019, Oklahoma implemented permitless carry legislation, allowing individuals aged 21 and older (or 18â€“20 if in the military) to carry firearms openly or concealed without needing a background check or handgun license. However, these individuals must comply with all applicable state and federal laws; otherwise, they risk arrest and prosecution.

Despite permitless carry, individuals may still apply for a concealed handgun license for reciprocity purposes with other states. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) oversees the application process, which includes demonstrating residency and completing firearm safety training approved by the Oklahoma Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training (CLEET).

Exceptions for carrying firearms exist for law enforcement officers, as well as for self-defense, hunting, educational purposes, and certain recreational activities.

### Prohibited Locations

Despite relaxed firearm carry laws, Oklahoma prohibits firearms in specific locations, including government buildings open to the public, courthouses, prisons, schools, colleges, and venues where alcohol sales are primary. Exceptions exist for authorized personnel and specific circumstances.

### Overview of Oklahoma Gun Control Laws

Similar to other states, Oklahoma has implemented a preemption law preventing local municipalities like Oklahoma City from passing gun control ordinances conflicting with state law.

Whether you have a license or not, you may not carry a firearm with a criminal intent and must follow location restrictions.
