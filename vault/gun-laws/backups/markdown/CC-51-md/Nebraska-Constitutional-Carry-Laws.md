### Overview of Federal and State Gun Laws

Federal and state gun laws regulate the sale, purchase, possession, and use of firearms in the U.S. While changes in federal law are infrequent, state laws frequently change and can vary significantly. State gun control laws may limit who can purchase a firearm, set procedures for background checks and waiting periods, and address the legality of concealed or open carry laws.

Nebraska gun control laws are less restrictive compared to many other states. The state has enacted more restrictions on handguns than on rifles and shotguns.

### Second Amendment and Supreme Court Decision

The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides citizens with the right to bear arms for traditional purposes such as self-defense. As a result, gun owners often challenge state and local laws that ban or limit firearm possession or use. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen (2022) involved a state regulatory scheme for issuing concealed carry permits.

In this case, petitioners argued their applications for permits to carry firearms for self-defense were denied on subjective and arbitrary grounds. The New York law allowed authorities to issue a permit when an applicant showed proper cause. The Court invalidated the law, agreeing that its subjective evaluation for permits violated the Constitution. It held that citizens have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense and that state regulations must use objective criteria such that a permit shall issue when such criteria are met. The Court also placed the burden on the government to show that a regulation is consistent with historical firearms regulation.

### Implications of the Bruen Decision

In light of the Bruen decision, state and local governments seeking to address gun violence by enacting new firearms restrictions must demonstrate how a gun control law aligns with historical firearms regulations. In several states, including Nebraska, the decision encouraged efforts to pass constitutional carry or permitless carry laws. Such laws allow citizens to carry firearms in public without a permit for purposes such as self-defense, whether the firearm is concealed or openly carried.

In Nebraska, anyone 21 years or older who is not otherwise prohibited can carry a concealed handgun with or without a concealed handgun permit. However, certain premises open to the public can prohibit non-law enforcement personnel from carrying a concealed handgun onto a premises by posting signs. Concealed carry of a handgun is not permitted at the following locations:

  * Stations of police, sheriff, or the Nebraska state patrol
  * Detention facilities, prisons, and jails
  * Courtrooms or buildings containing a courtroom
  * Polling places during a bona fide election
  * Meetings of governing bodies for cities, counties, school districts, and other political subdivisions
  * Places of worship
  * Meetings of the state legislature or committees of the legislature
  * Financial institutions
  * Professional or semi-professional sporting events and school sports events
  * Hospitals, emergency rooms, and trauma centers
  * Political rallies and fundraisers
  * Certain establishments with a liquor license



Nebraska has also passed a law that preempts local regulations of firearms that are inconsistent with state law. As a result, stricter gun ordinances and regulations in Omaha and Lincoln, the stateâ€™s two largest cities, are currently facing challenges in the courts.

### Background Checks and Self-Defense Laws

Nebraska law requires background checks for only certain purchases or transfers of firearms. Federal firearms law requires a background check on purchases from a federal firearms dealer. Nebraska gun laws require a background check on handgun purchases that occur through a dealer or in a private sale, with some exceptions for antique firearms, those purchased for a law enforcement agency, and transactions between certain family members. Private sale transfers of rifles and shotguns are not subject to background checks under state law.

Nebraska self-defense statutes do not currently include a stand-your-ground law. State law also does not provide a red flag law that permits the confiscation or prohibition of firearms from persons deemed a threat to themselves or others.
