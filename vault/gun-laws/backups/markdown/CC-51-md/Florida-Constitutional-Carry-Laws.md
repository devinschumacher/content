### Overview of Gun Laws in Florida

### Federal Firearms Law

While most gun regulations are state-level, federal laws apply nationwide, licensing gun dealers and restricting ownership of certain weapons like machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, and silencers. Federal law also prohibits firearm possession by certain individuals, such as convicted felons and drug users.

### Florida Gun Control Laws

Florida‚Äôs gun laws are less restrictive compared to many states. The state does not ban assault weapons or limit magazine capacity and does not require a purchase permit or firearm license. However, there is a three-day waiting period between purchasing and receiving a firearm. After the Parkland shooting, additional gun control measures were enacted.

### Stand Your Ground Laws in Florida

In 2005, Florida implemented the nation‚Äôs first stand-your-ground law, which became prominent after the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman. The law allows individuals to use force in self-defense without the duty to retreat if they believe it will prevent death, great bodily harm, or a forcible felony. It also provides immunity from criminal prosecution and civil suits when self-defense is claimed.

### The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act

Signed into law on March 9, 2018, following the Parkland shooting, this act made several changes:

  * Banned bump stocks
  * Extended mental health services
  * Introduced a red flag law allowing courts to temporarily remove firearms from those deemed at risk
  * Permitted sheriffs to appoint trained school employees as ‚Äúguardians‚Äù to be armed on school grounds



### Florida Concealed Carry Law

Before 2023, individuals needed to apply for a concealed weapons license, pass a background check, and complete firearms safety training. This process helped prevent unauthorized possession and aided law enforcement.

In 2023, Florida enacted a permitless carry law, allowing eligible individuals to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Despite this, many still apply for the state license to benefit from reciprocity in other states.

### Restrictions on Carrying Firearms

Regardless of license status, firearms are prohibited in certain locations, including:

  * Schools and administration buildings
  * Colleges and universities
  * Places of nuisance (e.g., houses of prostitution)
  * Law enforcement facilities
  * Detention facilities and prisons
  * Courthouses
  * Polling places
  * Government and legislative meetings
  * School and professional athletic events
  * Career centers
  * Portions of bars serving alcohol
  * Airports
  * Hospitals providing mental health services
  * Federally prohibited locations



Exceptions may apply for law enforcement or designated security officers in specific situations.
