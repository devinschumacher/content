### Overview of Gun Control Debates in the U.S.

Gun control debates in the U.S. often come down to differing views on the role of firearms in public safety. Both sides claim safety as their main concern, but they take conflicting approaches to achieve it.

Gun rights advocates argue that increasing gun ownership among law-abiding citizens empowers people to deter or confront gun violence. In contrast, supporters of gun violence prevention efforts call for stricter gun laws to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of criminals and those who misuse them.

Wisconsin gun laws aim to balance supporting citizensâ€™ gun rights with maintaining reasonable regulations.

### Supreme Court Rulings and the Second Amendment

In recent rulings, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that the Second Amendment guarantees individuals the right to bear arms for self-defense both at home and in public. This has led to legal challenges to both old and new gun regulations. Keeping up with changes in the law, whether through legislation or court rulings, can be challenging for gun owners and the general public alike.

### Federal Gun Laws

Federal law applies to all 50 states, with most regulations stemming from the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), as amended. These laws set up a framework for the legal manufacture, sale, possession, and use of firearms. Anyone purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed gun dealer must undergo a criminal background check.

Federal law prevents certain persons from buying, owning, or possessing firearms, including convicted felons, illegal drug users, and those with misdemeanor convictions or restraining orders related to domestic abuse. States can often enact stricter laws in these areas.

### Wisconsin Gun Laws at a Glance

Wisconsin, like all states, complies with federal firearms laws, including those set out in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which amended the GCA. Wisconsin also follows the NFA provisions related to certain dangerous weapons and has its own gun laws.

State gun laws often restrict the types of guns people can own and where they can use them. Some states require universal background checks on all gun sales, but Wisconsin only requires background checks for firearms purchased through dealers.

While some states have permitless carry laws, Wisconsin does not. However, it allows gun owners to carry firearms on their person without a permit at their homes, businesses, and on their land.

In most cases, Wisconsin requires individuals to be 18 years old or older to possess a firearm, with exceptions for military personnel, minors engaged in supervised target practice, and hunting.

### Open and Concealed Carry in Wisconsin

Wisconsin allows open carry of firearms by those not prohibited from possessing them. State law also prevents charges of disorderly conduct under a local ordinance for loading, carrying, or going armed with a firearm, unless there is other evidence of criminal intent.

Wisconsin requires a state license for the concealed carry of firearms in public. The law defines a weapon as a handgun, electric weapon (taser), or billy club. To obtain a concealed carry weapon (CCW) license, you must apply to the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ).

State licenses are only issued to Wisconsin residents and active-duty members of the armed forces who reside in Wisconsin. The DOJ provides a helpful website with a FAQ section on the application process, reciprocity with other states, and more.

### Prohibited Locations for Firearms in Wisconsin

Whether you open carry or conceal carry, avoid taking a firearm to these locations:

  * Police station, sheriffâ€™s office, state patrol station, or DOJ special agent office
  * Prisons, jails, correctional facilities
  * Certain mental health facilities

  * County, state, or federal courthouses
  * Municipal courtrooms if court is in session
  * Any part of an airport past the security checkpoint
  * Your job, if the employer prohibits firearms
  * Private property or businesses if the owner prohibits firearms



Certain places that ban firearms provide exceptions for those with a valid CCW permit, including:

  * State wildlife refuges
  * State fish hatcheries
  * Buildings owned or leased by the state or a political subdivision like a city or county
  * Taverns, hotels, and restaurants unless the CCW permit holder consumes alcoholic beverages in these locations
