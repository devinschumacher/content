# IP Address Fingerprinting

The main tools for checking IP address privacy showcase server-side abilities to uncover a user's identity.

These include displaying your IP address, reverse IP lookup, and HTTP request headers, your country, state, city, ISP/ASN, and local time.

The tool also includes features such as IP address whois lookup, TCP/IP OS fingerprinting, WebRTC, DNS, and IPv6 leak tests.
