# Django URLs (urls.py)

When a user requests a URL in the browser, Django decides which *view* it will send the user to, which is defined in the `[urls.py](http://urls.py)` file.

The `[urls.py](http://urls.py)` file goes in your app’s folder, in the same directory as the `[views.py](http://views.py)` file:

```python
# django_project/django_app/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('index/', views.django_app, name='home'),
]
```
