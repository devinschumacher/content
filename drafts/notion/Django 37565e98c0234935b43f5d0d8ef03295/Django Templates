# Django Templates

A template in Django typically refers to an HTML page template, but it can also be in other file formats to present other results.

Django templates use standard HTML to handle web page structure of each page template, but adds in template tags to allow for logic & dynamic content.

```jsx
<h1>This is my static heading</h1>

<p>My name is {{ firstname }}.</p>
```

In Django, all of the HTML template files are located in a `templates/` directory.
