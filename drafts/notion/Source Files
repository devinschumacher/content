# Source Files

Topics: Bootstrap

**Source files** are files that are meant to be processed by a theme’s build tools.

## Types of source files

### **SCSS files**

**SCSS files are always source files** because they *must be compiled* by your theme’s build tool to generate a CSS file that a browser can understand.

### **HTML files with any non-standard syntax are source files.**

Some themes make use of libraries to create "includes" for elements shared across multiple pages. These includes *must be compiled* by your theme’s build tool to generate standard HTML.

Source files are commonly in folders named `src/` or `app/`

## Build Tools

Build tools (like **[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)) are JavaScript libraries used to compile a theme’s source files and create a local server**

Each library has different syntax and capabilities and it’s up to each author which library they prefer to use. They all achieve the same result end result: allow us to compile source files and view those changes immediately in a browser.

You run a "build process" to *compile* source files and create a local server to preview pages.

Compiled files are often found in `/dist`, `public/`, or `build/` folders.

## Local development setup process

The basic process of setting up local development is roughly the same in every theme:

1. Install a theme’s dependencies from your command line via npm. (i.e. `npm install`)
2. Run a "watch" or "build" command powered by Gulp, Grunt, or Webpack build tools. (i.e. `npm start` or `gulp`)
3. Open your browser to your local server’s address (i.e. open Chrome to `localhost:3000`)
4. Edit source files and preview changes instantly with live reload
