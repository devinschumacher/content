â€¢ ML Algorithm: A set of rules and procedures used by a machine learning system to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning: Training machines to learn from data without every function they can perform be explicitly programmed.

Let's a step back to understand this better.

ðŸ‘‡

Traditionally, computers must have everything explicitly defined in order to perform a task.

This means every possible scenario the program may encounter must be pre-programmed by a human.

The program will only be able to execute tasks based on these pre-defined rules.

ðŸ‘‡

If the program encounters something it hasn't been pre-programmed to deal with - it will not be able to continue operating.

There's no room for "improvisation", "learning on the job" or any "learning" at all.

ðŸ‘‡

### Example: 49 state capitols

Imagine a program that has been given the capitol for 49 states in the USA.

If you ask if for the capitol of a state that it was pre-programmed with, it can tell you.

- Human: What's the capitol of California?
- Computer: Sacramento.

ðŸ‘‡

But what if you asked it for the capitol of that 50th state it was never pre-programmed to have a response for?

- Human: What's the capitol of (that 50th state you didn't get programmed with) Hawaii?
- Computer: Error.

ðŸ‘‡

Without being given the response for every possible input, the machine cannot properly answer.

It has no capacity to understand what you're asking if it was not pre-programmed with that scenario.

ðŸ‘‡

Enter: Machine Learning

With ML, programs are designed to learn from data, improve over time & find solutions without each scenario pre-loaded.

They learn like humans: recognizing patterns.

Using past info to guide future decisions when similar situations arise.

ðŸ‘‡

### Example: Panda Dogs

Imagine you want to teach a computer to recognize a certain breed of dog.

With traditional programming, you'd need to write code to detect specific attributes that the machine could use to positively identify the dog.

ðŸ‘‡

- 4 legs
- fur
- paws
- etc.

Maybe you give it 100 images of dogs, with features labeled, and 100 images of pandas with it's labels:

- 4 legs
- fur
- paws
- black around eyes

Next time it comes across these image - it would know what it is, bc it had seen them before.

ðŸ‘‡

After seeing images, with explicitly labeled features you're feeling confident about the machine.

So it's presented with a test... Captcha time!

Label: dog or panda:

- *beep boop**
1. panda
2. panda

ðŸ‘‡

Children see animals, and are told "dog" or "panda".

(Maybe the occasional "the cow says 'moo'", "the dog says 'ruff'" kinda thing)

But we aren't given EVERY feature and told to mentally archive animals based on thousands of possible feature combinations.

ðŸ‘‡

Our brains are not wired for information storage & retrieval in that way - so to make up for it we recognize patterns, make associations, and have the ability for "critical thinking".

Machines don't.

Until they are built to learn like humans do.

ðŸ‘‡

Machine learning attempts to let machines learn like humans learn.

By providing large sets of data ("datasets") aka "a bunch of examples of X", the ML algorithm is designed to extract associations, patterns, etc. like humans do.

ðŸ‘‡

The main difference is that humans learn with sensory input from: sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing.

Machines understand numbers, so their sensory input comes from converting inputs to numbers, and finding the patterns between those.

ðŸ‘‡

Given enough examples in the training 'data set', the machine can extract enough relationships, patterns, associations in the numbers to make accurate decisions when presented with new data it had not previously seen.

The machine can learn.

ðŸ‘‡

Traditional programming = recall explicitly provided previous information to make decision.

Machine learning = recall previously provided information, recognize patterns & associations, make decision on new information.
