## What is SQL?

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

## What Can SQL do?

- SQL can execute queries against a database
- SQL can retrieve data from a database
- SQL can insert records in a database
- SQL can update records in a database
- SQL can delete records from a database
- SQL can create new databases
- SQL can create new tables in a database
- SQL can create stored procedures in a database
- SQL can create views in a database
- SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

## SQL is a Standard - BUT....

Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `WHERE`) in a similar manner.

To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

- An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
- To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
- To use SQL to get the data you want
- To use HTML / CSS to style the page

## RDBMS

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

Look at the "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain specific information about every record in the table.

A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.

A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.

- Field
- Record

### Database

A database is … [insert definition and shit here]

Databases consist of tables, filled with data.

Think of a database as kind of like what you see when you open a new Google Sheets Spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet is the database.

### Table

A table is ….[insert formal definnition].

Tables store data, in the form of records.

Tables are kind of like the tabs at the bottom of the sheet, like the one that says ‘Sheet 1’ when you create a new Google Sheet’s Spreadsheet.

You can create multiple tables inside of a single database.

**Database table example:**

| CustomerID | CustomerName | ContactName | Address | City | PostalCode | Country |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57 | Berlin | 12209 | Germany |
| 2 | Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados | Ana Trujillo | Avda. de la Constitución 2222 | México D.F. | 05021 | Mexico |
| 3 | Antonio Moreno Taquería | Antonio Moreno | Mataderos 2312 | México D.F. | 05023 | Mexico |
| 4 | Around the Horn | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP | UK |
| 5 | Berglunds snabbköp | Christina Berglund | Berguvsvägen 8 | Luleå | S-958 22 | Sweden |

The table above contains five records (one for each customer) and seven columns (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, and Country).

Fields

Fields are … [formal definition]

Fields are like the columns you are used to from spreadsheets.

### Records

Records are … [formal definition]

Records are like the rows you are used to from spreadsheets.

## Recap

| SQL | Analogy |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Spreadsheet |
| Table | Tab |
| Field | Column |
| Record | Row |

## Syntax

`SELECT` is like asking to get back columns.

`FROM` is basically like telling SQL which table you want to grab the result from.

`*` means everything

### Examples

```sql
// asking to see all of the records (rows) and all of the fields (column) in the table (sheet)

SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

```sql
// ask to see just 1 field (columns) called 'columnName' from the table

SELECT columnName FROM table_name;
```
