# Data Matching Process

1. Data Pre-processing

## **Data pre-processing**

Data pre processing ensures data from multiple sources are in the same format, are appropriately cleaned & standardized. 

Some **major steps in data pre-processing:**

1. Removing unwanted characters and words
2. Expand abbreviations & correct misspellings
3. Segment attributes into well-defined consitent output attributes
4. **Handling Missing Values**: Determine how to handle missing values in the dataset. Some common strategies include removing records with missing values or imputing missing values.
5. **Data Transformation**: Normalize or standardize numerical fields, encode categorical fields, and so on.
6. **Data Cleaning**: Handle outliers, invalid values, or errors in the dataset.
7. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may be useful for analysis.
