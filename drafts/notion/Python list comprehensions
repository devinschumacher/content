## Converting a `for loop` that builds a “new list” into a `list comprehension`:

1. Make new_list variable: `new_list`
2. Add brackets to the new list variable using assignment operator (`=`): `variable = [ ]`
3. add output expression
4. for clause: “for thing in list

```python
# original list
movies = ['die hard', 'harry potter', 'star wars']

# for loop
movies2 = []
for movie in movies:
    movies2.append(movie.title())

print(movies2)

# output
['Die Hard', 'Harry Potter', 'Star Wars']
```

Lets turn it into a list comprehension following the steps:

```python
# original list
movies = ['die hard', 'harry potter', 'star wars']

# new empty list
movies2 = []

# add the item we are appending
movies2 = [
    movie.title()
]

# add the "for loop" without the colon ( : )
movies2 = [
    movie.title()
    for movie in movies
]
```

When you run it all together:

```python
# original list
movies = ['die hard', 'harry potter', 'star wars']

# new empty list
movies2 = []

# add the "for loop" without the colon ( : )
movies2 = [
    movie.title()
    for movie in movies
]

print(movies2)

# output
['Die Hard', 'Harry Potter', 'Star Wars']
```

You can also run it in a single line:

```python
# original list
movies = ['die hard', 'harry potter', 'star wars']

# new empty list
movies2 = []

# add the "for loop" without the colon ( : )
movies2 = [ movie.title() for movie in movies ]

print(movies2)

# output
['Die Hard', 'Harry Potter', 'Star Wars']
```

Notice there is no need for the `.append()` method anymore, because you’ve built your loop inside of the new list!
