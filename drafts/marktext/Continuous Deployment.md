# Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment means working software is released to users automatically on every commit.

You can *deploy* without *releasing*. You deploy software, but send no traffic to it.

An optional step beyond continuous delivery.

Continuous delivery is a software development practice in which working software is released to users as quickly as it makes sense for the project and is built in such a way that it has been proven that this can safely be done at any time.

## Benefits of frequent deployments

1. Deploying more frequently decreases the amount of risk of each deployment, bc they will have fewer changes and a lower chance that a deployment will contain a bug that causes a production failure.

2. Easier to trace a problem in a release back to the change that caused it - and your ability to automatically revert the change.
