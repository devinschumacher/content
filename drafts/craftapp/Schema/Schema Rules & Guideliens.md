1. The more, the better: Generally speaking, it is better to mark up more content. But, only mark up content that's visible to users. Don't markup content contained in hidden hidden divs or page elements.

**Google's Structured Data Policiesd (don't get penalized!)**

Google's policies on structed data are pretty easy to avoid for the most part. Mostly, they're meant to keep you from doing obviously shady things, like marking up items with incorrect schema just to try and get more snippets on the SERPs.

It can work. I've done it. But it's not recommended, because you could get slapped with a manual action.

And those aren't fun.  Trust me, I've had those too.

Google's policies on structed data fall into 2 categories: technical & quality.

### Technical Guidelines

Test your technical compliance with Google's [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) & [URL Inspection tool](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9012289).
