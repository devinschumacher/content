I have been using ZenMate VPN for the past few months and I must say that I am very pleased with the service. It has been easy to use and set up, providing strong security and privacy protection with just a few clicks.

The connection speeds have also been great and I have been able to unblock websites and access restricted content that was not available before. I have also been able to stream videos without any buffering issues.
