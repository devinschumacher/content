Browsers have a lot of information that might seem trivial but can be used to create a fingerprint to identify people with high accuracy.

This is known as a [browser fingerprint](https://fingerprint.com/blog/browser-fingerprinting-techniques/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=blog), and statistics show that if you put this information together, your browser fingerprint will only match [1 in 286,777](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/) others.

[Browser fingerprinting](https://fingerprint.com/blog/browser-fingerprinting-techniques/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=blog) works by reading browser attributes and combining them into a single identifier removing the need for cookies or asking for permission. This identifier is stateless and works well in normal and incognito modes to identify users uniquely and their associate sessions regardless of anonymizing tactics like incognito browsing, VPNs, and cookie blockers.

Fingerprinting takes in data from the browser to help build a unique profile for each user on your site. By capturing the following specifics, fingerprinting software can identify suspicious traffic without an IP address or cookie

In addition, unlike third-party cookies which can be cleared or blocked by the browser. you cannot alter your browser fingerprint.

## Hereâ€™s a list of things data points that can be used to create a unique profile of you online:
