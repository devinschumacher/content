# Pandas Read CSVs

## Read CSV Files

A simple way to store big data sets is to use CSV files (comma separated files).

CSV files contains plain text and is a well know format that can be read by everyone including Pandas.

In our examples we will be using a CSV file called 'data.csv'.

If you have a large CSV with many rows, Pandas will only return the first 5 rows, and the last 5 rows:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print(df
```

if you want to print the entire DataFrame, use the `to_string()` method:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print(df.to_string())
```

## **max_rows**

The number of rows returned is defined in Pandas option settings.

You can check your system's maximum rows with the  statement: `pd.options.display.max_rows`

Let’s check the number of maximum returned rows:

```python
import pandas as pd

print(pd.options.display.max_rows)
```

We can use the same statement to alter the max_rows:

```python
import pandas as pd

print.pd.options.display.max_rows = 999

df = read_csv('data.csv')

print(df)
```
