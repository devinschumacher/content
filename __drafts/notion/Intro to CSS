# Intro to CSS

## What is CSS?

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to “style” web pages.

CSS is used to define style for HTML elements, like how they should be displayed - from color, to size, to position, etc.

It was created by the World Wide Web Consortium as a way to provide styling to HTML documents, without having to add additional code into the HTML documents themselves.

The purpose of HTML is to provide structure, and describe the various types of content, for a web page. Anything related to the design, style & display of that HTML markup should be handled by something other than the HTML. 

Most of this styling is handled by CSS.

## Where do you write CSS?

### Inline CSS

CSS *can* be written “inline” - meaning within the HTML markup itself - but it is not the ideal/preferred method.

**Example - Inline CSS:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

### Internal CSS

Internal CSS refers to using CSS inside of an HTML document, but differs from inline CSS in that you define all of the CSS in the `<head>` are inside of `<style>` tags. 

So, its a little more flexible than inline CSS - but still not the best option.

**Example - Internal CSS:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

### External CSS

CSS can also be written in a completely separate `.css` file, typically called a ‘stylesheet’, and then referenced from the HTML document.

This is the preferred method for writing CSS.

**An example of external CSS:**

```css
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

h1 {
  color: black;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: helvetica;
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

Can you see how CSS is working here to give specific display instructions to the various HTML elements: `body` , `h1` , `p` ?

**This CSS says:**

- Make the `background-color` of the HTML `body` display in the color “pink”.
- Make all `h1` HTML tags display with:
    - `color` ”black”
    - `text-align` “center aligned”
- Make all `p` HTML tags display with:
    - `font-family` ”helvetica”
    - `font-size` “18px”

## CSS Stylesheets

Writing all of your CSS in an external stylesheet provides the convenience of keeping all your CSS in one place - which makes it easier to edit later without having to go into multiple documents.

It also allows you the flexibility to write variations of how you want your website to be displayed - as you can simply create multiple stylesheets and then decide which one you want to use for the styling of your website.

CSS is also used to define how your website will appear on other devices.
