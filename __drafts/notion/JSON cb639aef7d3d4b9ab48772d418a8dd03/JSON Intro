# JSON Intro

---

**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation (JSON) is a “text format” or data that makes storing, understanding, and “transporting” easy.

JSON creates “Objects” in a structured manner that makes it easy for computers, programs, etc. to understand relationships of the data.

For example, let’s say you wanted to store information about your friend Anthony, in JSON.

```json

{ "friend": { "name": "Anthony", "age": 35, "favoriteFood": "sushi" } }

// can also be displayed like this to see the "object" structure more clearly

{
  "friend": {
    "name": "Anthony",
    "age": 35,
    "favoriteFood": "sushi"
  }
}
```

This is a JSON `object` called “friend” with 3 `properties` and their associated `values`.

These `property` : `value` things are called “key-value” pairs.

JSON `object` for “friend”:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | Anthony |
| age | 35 |
| favoriteFood | sushi |

Writing JSON is kind of like how us human use lists (like bullet points lists, or outlines) to visualize the structure and organization of things. 

I guess the human equivalent of this would be something like:

**My friend Anthony:**

- Age: 35
- Favorite Food: sushi

Well, how about a group of friends? What then?

```json

{ "friendsList": { "friend": [{ "name": "Anthony", "age": 35, "favoriteFood": "sushi" }, { "name": "Alex", "age": 35, "favoriteFood": "burritos" }] }}

// can also be displayed like this to see the "object" structure more clearly

{
  "friendsList": {
    "friend": [
      {
        "name": "Anthony",
        "age": 35,
        "favoriteFood": "sushi"
      },
      {
        "name": "Alex",
        "age": "36",
        "favoriteFood": "burritos"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here we can see we have an `object` “friendsList” that contains an `array` (also an `object`) of individual “friend” `objects` - each with `properties` and corresponding `values`.

Human equivalent of this might look something like:

**My friends:**

- Anthony
    - age: 35
    - favorite food: sushi
- Alex
    - age: 36
    - favorite food: burritos

Humans can infer very easily that “Anthony” and “Alex” are our friends names. Because we grew up meeting people with those names - so we just know by experience, association, and semantics that those are their names. 

We don’t need to write it like this:

**My friends:**

- name: Anthony
    - age: 35
    - favorite food: sushi
- name: Alex
    - age: 36
    - favorite food: burritos
    

^ That would be kind of a weird outline for us, don’t you think?

But computers are dumb-dumbs and don’t know things like this, so we have to be much more specific in our defining of what each thing is - and that is where “syntax” comes into play
