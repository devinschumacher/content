# Timezone

Timezone can be used as a digital fingerprint when it comes to online privacy because a person's timezone can be used to track their activities online.

For example, if someone accesses a website from a specific timezone, their activity can be tracked, making it easier for them to be identified.

Additionally, some websites may use a person's timezone to adjust the website's content accordingly, which can reduce a person's personal privacy.

Websites can discover your time zone in two ways.

- The first one is by running your IP address through an Ip2Geo database.
- The second way is by using a JavaScript function that reads time zone through browser API from regional settings of your operating system.

::Websites then check whether the results of these two checks match. If they don't, it is likely that you are using a proxy server located in a different time zone than your computer.::

Therefore, it's vital for your privacy to match the system time zone retrieved through JavaScript to the proxy location.
